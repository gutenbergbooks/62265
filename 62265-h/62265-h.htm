<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>It sometimes happens that the study of the principles
of composition is left until the overcrowded
last year of the high school, under the plea that
facts ought to precede generalizations. Is it not
better to have the pupil begin two or three years
earlier than this to frame simple generalizations
for his own future guidance? The first year student
daily awakes to new experiences and problems.
He demands rules and reasons: “<i>How</i> shall
he choose theme topics? <i>How much</i> shall he
put into a sentence? <i>Why</i> is <i>electrocution</i> in bad
usage?” If the principle is asked for, should it
not be given—as much of it as can be digested?
When such a course is followed, time enough is
left in the high school for composition to become
a habit. The complex process wherein invention,
as it proceeds, is rectified by criticism, involves
many delicate reflexes. The formulated principle,
invaluable to the student in revising, in turn grows
to be an unconscious factor in every succeeding act
of composition.</p>

<p>The more essential rules ought not to be mere
phantoms to the boy just completing his first year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
in the secondary school. In regard to other matters
of living, great principles are taught him from
infancy, without the slightest fear of setting up too
analytic a state of mind. If a boy of three may be
told “always to do one thing at a time,” must a
boy be eighteen before he is told “always to
write about one thing at a time”? At three the
child is required to control some of his strongest
emotions; must he be eighteen before he is asked
to check digressions in the paragraph? And is it
possible to implant a genuine habit of checking
digressions except by leading the student from
particular instances to some generalization which
he may keep in mind as a norm for future self-criticism?
Synthesis and analysis cannot safely
be separated; a good prescription for most rhetorical
disorders is, more of both. Indeed, what seems
to be needed to-day in teaching composition is not
one thing, but several: on the one hand, more
utilization of literature and more appeal to social
interests; on the other hand, more inductions and
generalizations by the student himself; on both
hands, more time for practice and self-criticism.</p>

<p>In the present book, originally printed privately
for my own classes and now rewritten and enlarged,
I have tried to present a large number of definite
situations to be faced for constructive practice both
in organization and in diction; and to give in
simple, even colloquial language, all the larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
generalizations which a boy presenting himself at
college might reasonably be expected to have been
using for two or three years as touchstones of his
own work. Except in the chapters on punctuation
and grammar, the order of reaching generalizations
is meant to be essentially inductive. In these
review-chapters a part of the principles come
before the illustrations in order to get the help of
all past associations. Even here the induction is
often gone through with a second time, leading up
to a restatement of the principle. It is recommended
that students should often be asked to
frame generalizations of their own, though the text-book
may have led up to similar ones. In Chapters
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X.</a>, on words, I have tried to present conditions
favorable to the framing of definitions by
the student. By various devices I have constantly
tried to avoid separation between exercise critical
and exercise constructive. Occasionally, after the
correct form has been studied, bad English is offered
for correction, for the sake of the appeal to
the student’s personal pride and his sense of the
ridiculous; but in general it is assumed that the
student’s correction of his own bad English will
afford plenty of contact with faulty forms.</p>

<p>The book is primarily intended to be used in
close connection with the literary studies of the
first two years of the secondary course. It may
be used later if the arrangement of subjects allows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
little time for literature in these earlier years.
The order of presentation should,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the author’s
opinion, follow that of the book. Still, Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII.</a>, on correct choice of words, may be taken at
the start if the teacher prefers. Where a good deal
of literary study is carried on in the first year, the
first eight chapters are perhaps enough for this
year. But a rate of progress cannot be prescribed.
A text-book is a mere help, and bad in proportion
as it tries to be anything more. Its function seems
to be to supply the supplementary appeal to the
eye, since the living teacher can engage to do this
but to a limited extent. It appears obvious that
the book should be read slowly enough to permit
two things—much parallel literary study, and
much revision of themes in the light of preceding
chapters. First drafts are sometimes all that are
worth making; but usually a task requiring connected
discourse is not finished until there have
been several revisions. If the student writes each
new composition with a view to one particular kind
of excellence, and then revises with reference to
the kinds of excellence he has previously striven
for, he will gradually be able to hold several stylistic
principles in mind as he composes. Many
themes should be written in class. A limited period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
should be set for the first draft; and half as
much time may well be spent in revising before
this is handed in. In this revision the student
may profitably read his theme as many times as
there are chapters to be mentally reviewed.</p>

<p>The remarkable strength of the verbal memory
in students of the first two years of the secondary
school is a fact by which every teacher must have
been impressed.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Add to this fact the other, that
the pupil’s social interests are now in a perfect
renaissance of liveliness, and you have exactly the
conditions for enlarging the working vocabulary.
It is now or never. The boy, though like the man
he hates a fine distinction in conversation, is growing
out of the exaggerated reticence which has
of late seemed to him the manly thing. He is no
longer determined to employ what Mrs. Meynell,
speaking of the boy of twelve, calls his “carefully
shortened vocabulary.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The girl, even more than
the boy, is full of new ideas which would flower
into speech if the words were to be had. To capture
these new interests and satisfy them by literature
is of course the best thing. Study of isolated
words, whether for knowledge or for power, is but
supplementary to the study of the vital functions
of words in the living organism. But even the
study of synonyms, if pursued in preparation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
an oral debate,—one of the very best exercises
for first-year students,—or in connection with a
page of spirited prose, rapidly becomes constructive
and vital. Although the chapters on vocabulary
(<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X.</a>) may be given before the student
has begun a foreign language, the best results with
them will not be secured until he has had at least
six months in Latin. The study of prefixes and
suffixes (<a href="#Page_186">p. 186 ff.</a>) should not be made burdensome.
Some general view of the subject seems desirable,
but the detailed study is best given in connection
with an interesting context.</p>

<p>For kindly criticism or advice I have debts of
gratitude to Professor and Mrs. W. D. McClintock;
to Professor F. A. March, Professor John Dewey,
and Professor Robert Herrick; to several of my
colleagues, especially Director George M. Carman,
Miss Jane Noble, and Mr. Phil B. Kohlsaat; to
Mr. F. A. Manny, to Mrs. Hufford and Miss Dye,
of Indianapolis; to Superintendent A. F. Nightingale,
Miss Jones, and Miss Herrick, of the
Chicago high schools. I have been particularly
indebted to Carpenter’s <i>Advanced Exercises</i>, a book
made familiar to me by using it with freshmen in
college; and to Scott &amp; Denney’s <i>Paragraph-Writing</i>.
For the index I have to thank Miss L. E. W. Benedict,
librarian of Lewis Institute, and Mr. Lewis
Gustafson.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTORY_EXPLANATIONS">INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS</h2>

<p>Our plan provides for a good many short compositions.
These, as well as all other exercises,
should be written on uniform theme-paper,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> say
eight inches by ten, with a broad margin at both
sides. There are advantages in the double margin.
First, it is easier for the reader of the theme to
jot down his suggestions at the right, since he
need not turn the paper to do so. Secondly, it is
well for the student to learn the knack of keeping
<i>a straight edge</i> at the left hand. Only one side of
the paper should be written on. If a mistake is
made, a heavy line may be drawn through the
word. The manuscript ought to present the neatest
possible appearance. Blank spaces are to be
avoided at the end of lines, except where a paragraph
ends. The straight edge, referred to above,
is to be scrupulously preserved at the left of the
page, except that when a new paragraph (that is,
division of the theme) is to begin, the first line
of it should start about two inches farther to the
right than the other lines. The pages should be
carefully numbered in the upper right-hand corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and kept in their proper order. Nothing is
more disconcerting to any person who reads a
manuscript than to open the paper and find before
him the last page, rather than the first. Every
theme should have a definite title. This should
appear in the blank space at the top of the first
page and in the endorsement of the folded paper,
on the back of the last page. The theme should
be folded once, lengthwise. In the blank space at
the top should be written the endorsement, which
should follow this model: (1) name; (2) name of
course; (3) title; (4) date.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Richard Doe.</p>

<p>First year English.</p>

<p>A Dialogue on Politics.</p>

<p>Oct. 1, 189-.</p>

</div>

<p>After the themes have been read, whether by
the instructor alone or by the class and the
instructor, they will be returned with marginal
comments, and (just under the endorsement) a
summary of these comments. In many cases the
student will be expected to rewrite, and the word
<i>Rewrite</i> will appear with the general comment.
Otherwise he will be expected to <i>Revise</i>, that is,
to interline corrections and improvements on the
manuscript without copying it.</p>

<p>Each student’s papers will be filed and kept.
He will often be asked to consult with the instructor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
concerning his own progress, as shown by his
bundle of themes.</p>

<p>The following suggestive signs<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> may be used
in the margin of themes, indicating the presence
of errors, the actual errors to be discovered by
the pupil for himself. Some teachers will prefer
a simpler system of symbols, some a more elaborate
system. The suggested list can easily be modified
or supplanted.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ART OF WRITING ENGLISH</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>An Art of Communication.</b>—Language may be
studied in various ways. It may be scientifically
investigated as a historical growth, or as a curious
revelation of how the human mind works. This
kind of study has pure knowledge for its object; if
it learns the laws which govern language, it is satisfied.
Again, language may be studied with a view
to applying its principles to the art of self-expression.
The attempt to find words for one’s ideas
has enlivened many a weary hour for many a person
who wrote merely for his own satisfaction. But
the chief object for which language should be
studied is that it may be made a means of communication.</p>

<p>Most that is good in life comes from men’s ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to make their fellows share their thoughts and
feelings. But it is not always an easy thing to
make others see how we feel or think. The young
child is called an <i>infant</i>, a word which means <i>not-speaking</i>.
Half his miseries arise from his inability
to communicate his notions. “Men are but children
of a larger growth,” and much of their misery
results from inability to tell what they think or
feel. In a sense the case is worse for the man
than for the child. The latter makes gestures and
grimaces to help his meaning out; and he depends
not in vain on pitch and stress. The grown man is
partly shorn of these helps, in that he has to communicate
by letters and other compositions. How
much more work the eye does to-day than the ear!
Before the age of printing, things were different.</p>

<p>Both in speaking and in writing there are many
special laws that must be observed if there is to be
real communication. The special laws of spoken
language are not so numerous as those of written
language. Written language has to be much more
careful than spoken; the writer has no chance of
correcting himself on the spot if not understood.
Nevertheless a knowledge of how to communicate
by written words is a very great help in communicating
orally.</p>

<p>The art of communicating by means of written
English words is called English composition, or
rhetoric. The latter word once meant the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
speaking; and it still keeps this sense when a composition
is written to be delivered. Rhetoric is a
useful art, like that of curing the sick, or that of
building bridges. A matter of prime importance
to each man is that, in business or in society, he
should be able to say or write exactly what he
means; rhetoric helps him to do this. A business
man may lose money by failing to make himself
clearly understood; misunderstandings and quarrels
arise between friends because some one has
failed to write just what he meant; a man is liable
to be taken for a boor if he abuses the English language.
Rhetoric is an exceedingly practical art.</p>

<p>It would not, however, be fair to remove all emphasis
from the fact that rhetoric is a fine art, an
art of beauty. As soon as the student begins to master
the use of words, he has a chance to become an
artist in language. In producing a beautiful thing
he feels the artist’s pleasure. Most persons like
to play some musical instrument, or experiment
in color, or use a camera. Why should they not
come to enjoy the art of setting down their ideas
in words skilfully chosen, and arranged with delicate
precision? The old Greeks enjoyed it—those
people who knew how to extract so much high
pleasure from life. Along with their musical contests
and athletic contests, they had trials of skill
in poetry and in public speech.</p>

<p>There is no more delightful art than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
writing, if the writer finds words for his own fresh
impressions. In order to learn the mandolin, a
new player will train his wrist till it aches.
But thrumming music is doubtless small pleasure
compared with writing music; and writing English
is in a way like writing music,—a fine,
high, creative process, which, in the hands of a
master, results in a permanent, not a fleeting,
product.</p>

<p>A teacher of English recently said that, in a certain
sense, if a student likes any study at all he
can be brought to like composition also.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> She was
right. If he cares for mathematics, and the beautiful
precision by which everything in mathematics
falls exactly into its place, he will enjoy showing
the exact relations he conceives to exist between
the parts of his sentence. If a girl likes music
she will care for the music that is in prose. She
will perceive that a good sentence is free from
ugly sounds, and has furthermore a music of
rhythm, a finely modulated rise and fall that a
keen ear readily perceives. A lad declares himself
interested in inventing or in building machinery.
If so, why should he not enjoy building a
theme? To think out a new mechanical device
requires much the same kind of ingenuity, sense
of proportion, perception of cause and effect, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
are required in thinking out the logical framework
of a composition.</p>

<p>The student should work steadily toward the
point where he may come to have an abiding love
for that which is lucid and beautiful in expression
by words. He will never regret the time he
spends in perfecting his instrument of expression.
No matter how practical the life he plans to lead,
the power of writing down his ideas in good
English, in a way that will leave no doubt as
to what he meant and how earnestly he meant
it, will always profit him. One meets everywhere
men who lament that they gave so little
attention to our language when they were young
enough to master it.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Limitations of the Art.</b>—It must never be
supposed that, because to some extent a fine art,
rhetoric should be studied as an end in itself. What
was said a moment ago about the primary aim
of the study must be kept steadily in view. We
study the art of composition not for the art’s
sake, but to communicate our ideas and feelings.
Rhetoric does not profess to supply the student
with ideas, though it assumes that his mind is
stimulated to new thought by trying to express that
which he already has. The more ideas he brings
to the study,—ideas he has thought out in
life or in his other studies, like literature, history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
civics,—the more facility he will carry away;
for ideas are the very best of material to make
themes of. If composition does only one thing for
a given person,—if, namely, it brings him to a
sturdy habit of <i>finding something to say</i> before he
asks other people to listen to him,—it is eminently
worth while.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Write for an Audience.</b>—Writing is usually good
in proportion as the writer is interested in it. If
he cares for it, if he is anxious to find a worthy
thought and make it clear to the eyes of others,
he will be very likely to succeed in doing so.
Something of every student’s weekly work ought
to be good enough to come before the eyes of his
friends and to command his friends’ respect. The
student will find that his mates are keen critics;
they will not respect poor work. But they are
also fair and sympathetic critics, ready and willing
to surrender on sight to really good work. A class
as a whole will judge the compositions of each
member disinterestedly and appreciatively.</p>

<p>Whatever is most characteristic of you, as different
from other people; whatever gift is yours, of
imagination, or reasoning power, or emotion, or
humor,—all will find its fit expression in your
writing. Every human being is particularly interested
in something, is peculiarly apt at something.
To find out what most appeals to one’s self in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
literature or in life, and to voice one’s ideas about
it, is to know a keen pleasure. It is more. It is to
be of some use to one’s fellows. As human beings
we want other human beings to tell us the best
that is in them. If a man has ideas we wish to
share them—and wish him to learn how to express
them that we may share them. If he hasn’t
ideas, the effort to express what he considers such
will convince both him and us of the fact. But
then!—everybody has ideas.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ON READING ALOUD, AND ON SPELLING</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Reading Aloud.</b>—One of the quickest ways of
learning to know good English, is oral reading.
For him who would write the language it is therefore
a great economy to learn to read it. It is an
invaluable habit to read aloud every day some piece
of prose with the finest feeling the reader can lend
to it. In no other way can one so easily learn to
notice and to remember new words. In no other
way can one catch the infinitely varied rhythm of
prose, and acquire a sense of how a good sentence
rises gradually from the beginning and then descends
in a cadence. This rise and fall of the sentence
is not merely a matter of voice; it is a matter
of thought as well. Similarly, the law of unity
in the sentence, a law which prescribes what shall
constitute a complete thought, is curiously bound
up with the laws of the human voice. A clause
that is too long to be pronounced in a single breath
is usually clumsy in logic. In the next place, reading
aloud helps one to spell correctly. Furthermore,
it is the best means of detecting those useless
repetitions which betray poverty of vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau called accent the soul of language. If
the student reads aloud from writers whose work
was natural, unforced, original, he will gradually
come to see his own ideas more clearly, feel his
own feelings more keenly. Best of all, however,
let him read his own work aloud, habitually. This
will help him to see whether or not it is correct,
natural, effective.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Spelling.</b><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—Bad spelling should practically be a
thing of the past for each student by the end of
his first high school year. Every one can learn to
spell, though some more rapidly than others.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief reason why persons fail to
spell correctly is that they do not read correctly.
They have not trained their eyes to see what is on
the page; they do not notice the syllables. It is a
good practice to read every day a page or two very
slowly, examining the words letter by letter. It is
equally helpful to read the page aloud after examining
it. In so doing give every vowel its true
value; cut no syllable short that should be sounded
distinctly.</p>

<p>After writing a theme, go through it, challenging
the spelling. Do not hand in your work without
having consulted your own dictionary. A bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
speller may not be able to win in an oral spelling-match;
but there is no reason why every page of
his writing should not be perfect in orthography.</p>

<p>Into a little blank-book copy the correct form of
every word you misspell. Each day read over
carefully several words by syllables, and then write
them from memory. The more frequently the
hand writes the word in its correct form, the
better; for the hand has a memory of its own,
and the mere act of writing a given form tends
to fix it in memory.</p>

<p>Make good spelling a matter of pride. Habitual
bad spelling is a slovenly thing, a mark of illiteracy.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Spelling of Compound Words.</b>—It may be well
to call attention here to the use of the hyphen in
compound words.</p>

<p>1. The hyphen is needed in a compound adjective,
if there is any doubt as to the meaning when the
hyphen is omitted. “Red-hot iron” may be a
different idea from “red hot iron.”</p>

<p>2. Numbers like the following take the hyphen:
seventy-three, seventy-third.</p>

<p>3. Many a word once compounded is now written
solid, that is, as a single word: railroad, steamboat,
anybody, anything, raindrop, forever, schoolboy,
schoolhouse, schoolmate, schoolfellow (but school
days, school teacher, school district); myself, yourself
(but one’s self); childlike, lifelike. All these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
words but two, it will be seen, have a monosyllable
for the first part. When in doubt as to
whether or not a hyphen is needed, consult
some special manual like Bigelow’s <i>Handbook of
Punctuation</i>.</p>

<p>In all your writing, join distinctly syllables that
you wish to have go together. Notice the absurd
and misleading effect of such careless writing as
this: “He was a glass maker and worked down
at the glass house; his gal lant moust ache and
his loud voice trai ned by blow ing glass mad e
him wel come at the harvest home celebrations.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Possessives.</b>—The possessive singular of a monosyllable
ending in <i>s</i> is regularly made by adding <i>’s</i>,
pronounced as an extra syllable. Thus: Jones’s;
Briggs’s. For the polysyllable ending in <i>s</i> or the
sound of <i>s</i>, merely the apostrophe is usually required,
as in the plural. Thus: “Moses’ seat”;
“conscience’ sake.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Singulars and Plurals.</b>—Spell aloud by syllables,
and write from dictation the plurals of the following:
Analysis, animalcule, antithesis, appendix,
bandit, cherub, crisis, ellipsis, focus, fungus,
genus, hypothesis, madame, memorandum, monsieur,
mother-in-law, mussulman, nebula, oasis, parenthesis,
radius, spoonful, synopsis.</p>

<p>What are the singulars—if singulars there are—of
data, errata, magi, strata, vertebræ?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Below are given the correct
form of certain words often misspelled by pupils
in the first and second years of a secondary school.
Without previous study write each word from dictation.
Afterwards spell aloud by syllables each
word that you misspelled in writing from dictation.
Then write at least twenty times the correct form.
The object is to acquire a kind of automatic correctness.
In composing, one should have his mind
free for thought; one should not have to think
much more about spelling than about breathing.</p>

Eliot; Lord Macaulay; Michigan; Thackeray.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Word-Breaking.</b>—At the end of a line do not
divide (<i>a</i>) a monosyllable, (<i>b</i>) a short disyllable,
such as <i>real</i>, <i>doing</i>. Divide polysyllables according
to their etymological composition (to be found
in the dictionary). Some authors discountenance
beginning a second line with <i>-ic</i>, <i>-al</i>, <i>-ing</i>, <i>-ly</i>. These
breakings are perhaps permissible, <i>if the hyphen is
made very distinct</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written and Oral Exercise.</b>—The instructor
should ask each pupil in turn to recall, spell,
and pronounce some word that doubles the letter
<i>c</i>. The class should then be given a few minutes
to write from memory as many of those given as
they can recall. After this the pronouncing and
spelling should proceed as long as possible, alternately
with the writing. The lists should then be
compared, and the pupil who has reproduced the
largest number of words should be asked to spell
and pronounce each one on his list. The other
pupils should then be called upon to read from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
their own lists words that the first fails to give.
Each should then be asked to add to his paper all
words remembered by other members of the class,
but not by him.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Pronunciation.</b>—A person who regards good usage
in pronunciation and who articulates with unaffected
nicety, is received at once as an educated man. It
is interesting to see how often Lord Chesterfield,
the best-mannered of Englishmen, insists that a
gentleman is known by his accent. Chesterfield’s
letters to his son are full of this idea. A sense
of ease and security blesses him who knows how
to sound every word that occurs to him as he talks;
it is such a sense as a man feels when he is sure
that his clothes fit him and are cut according to
the accepted conventions. It is accordingly worth
all the trouble involved, to form a habit of letting
no word pass unchallenged as to its orthoëpy.
Look it up in the dictionary, or in a good manual like
Phyfe’s <i>Seven Thousand Words often Mispronounced</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Exercise.</b>—Below is given a short list of words
frequently mispronounced. The instructor should

<span class="smaller">A REVIEW OF PUNCTUATION</span></h2>

<p>Punctuation is a system of disjunctive marks by
which the eye and ear are helped to understand the
sense of what is written. It is desirable to regard
the subject as governed to a great extent by a few
principles of common sense. The present chapter
reviews those matters of capitalization and punctuation
which seem to give most trouble to secondary
school students.</p>

<h3><b>Capitals.</b></h3>

<p>1. Of course all proper nouns should begin with
capital letters, and so should adjectives derived
from them: examples, <i>Russia</i>, <i>Russian</i>, <i>Jew</i>, <i>Jewish</i>,
<i>Gentile</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>German</i>. But the word <i>christian</i>
is not always capitalized, especially if it is
used vaguely as a synonym for good, righteous, etc.</p>

<p>2. We capitalize the words <i>North</i>, <i>South</i>, <i>East</i>,
<i>West</i>, when, because we mean parts of the country,
we use the article <i>the</i> before them. Thus, “The extreme
West favors free silver.” But if we speak
of direction merely, we do not capitalize: “Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
people took Horace Greeley’s advice and went
west.” Capitalize sections of the country, but not
points of the compass.</p>

<p>3. Names of the seasons are not capitalized.
Thus, though we write <i>June</i>, <i>September</i>, we also
write <i>spring</i>, <i>autumn</i>.</p>

<p>4. In the salutation of a letter, the word <i>Sir</i> is
capitalized, but not the preceding adjective unless
that begins the salutation. Thus: “My dear Sir.”
So in the leave-taking only the first word receives
a capital. Thus: “Yours very truly.”</p>

<p>5. One valuable device is the use of the capital
to introduce the semblance of a quotation, or what
might be called a rhetorical quotation. Note: “I
should answer, No.” Here the quotation <i>No</i> is
merely rhetorical, or pretended, not real. Or this:
“Let me give you a short rule for success: Trust
in God and keep your powder dry.” Or this, from
Longfellow: “Perhaps the greatest lesson which
the lives of literary men teach us is told in a single
word: Wait!”</p>

<p>6. In titles of books, essays, etc., the important
words are capitalized. Thus: “My theme-title
to-day was, A Description of a Person.”</p>

<p>7. Names of Deity begin with a capital, and
many persons prefer to capitalize adjectives referring
directly to Deity. Thus: “We crave Thy
grace.” But this habit should not be carried so
far as the capitalization of words like <i>divine</i>, <i>omniscient</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
when these are not applied to Deity. Rather:
“His goodness was divine.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Copy the following, capitalizing
where necessary:—</p>

<p>1. After going south last spring I understood
better than before what is meant by the new south.
The southerners have taken to manufacturing; the
cotton is no longer all shipped away. Wealth
has multiplied. Immigration has increased—the
french are not the only foreigners now. There
are colleges and even universities, that compare
favorably with those of the north. Are the people
wide-awake and ambitious? I answer, yes.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Reasons for Punctuation.</b>—In early days manuscripts were written “solid,” thus:—</p>

<p class="center">MANUSCRIPTSWEREWRITTENSOLID.</p>

<p>It was found that both eye and ear demanded
spaces and punctuation. The reader’s train of
thought goes straight ahead from word to word
until the punctuation mark warns it that there
is danger of misunderstanding if it does not pause.
The mark shows that the words which precede it
are to be understood mentally as a group, and
to be read orally as a group. If the thought is
kept in mind that a punctuation mark is a sort
of danger signal, many of the difficulties of the
subject vanish. “Henry rose, and I with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
laughed at the story we had heard.” If that
comma be omitted between <i>rose</i> and <i>and</i>, what
happens?</p>

<h3><b>The Comma.</b></h3>

<p>1. The comma, even more than other points,
shows what the meaning of the sentence is; it
should set off the parts of the thought. Nothing is
easier than to spoil a minor unit of thought by
breaking it in two with a comma. So far as may
be, the modified subject of a sentence should not be
cut into by a comma; neither should the modified
predicate; nor should a subject and its predicate be
separated any oftener by commas than is necessary.
The following passage, written by a lad of fifteen
from dictation, shows the minor units of thought
divided by too many commas:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The mean appearance of the houses, in old Boston, was,
to some extent, relieved by the rich display, of painted, and
sculptured signs, which adorned the front of taverns, and
stores.... They served sometimes, as advertisements of
the business, sometimes merely as designations, of the shops
which were indicated popularly, and, in the newspapers, by
their signs.</p>

</div>

<p>If this passage be read aloud, a pause being made
wherever a comma is placed, it will sound unnatural,
disconnected. Revised, it will read somewhat
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The mean appearance of the houses in old Boston was,
to some extent, relieved by the rich display of painted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sculptured signs which adorned the front of taverns and
stores.... They served sometimes as advertisements of
the business, sometimes merely as designations of the shops,
which were indicated popularly and in the newspapers by
their signs.</p>

</div>

<p>2. Commas are used to set off matter that is
parenthetical, but not sufficiently so as to need
parentheses or dashes. Such words as <i>therefore</i>
are not usually to be considered as parenthetical.
A parenthetical group of words is not to be broken
into unnecessarily by a comma. Incorrect form:
“The squire remarked, as all we who live here, in
Smithboro, know, that, so far as the people who
lived over there, in Edinburgh, are concerned, we
are as happy as they.” Correct form: “The squire
remarked, as all we who live here in Smithboro’
know, that so far as the people who live over
there in Edinburgh are concerned, we are as happy
as they.”</p>

<p>3. Vocative words, that is, words used in direct
address, are set off by commas. “Come, men, let’s
go!” “Well, sir, how now?” It is curious that
in the expressions “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” in pronouncing
which we do not pause before “<i>sir</i>,” we
still place a comma here. Probably no rule of
punctuation is more neglected than this of vocative
words. Something like this usage is the placing of
a comma after the expletive <i>Now</i>. Thus: “Now,
I think that the case is a little different.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) Words or phrases forming a series are
separated by commas when conjunctions are
omitted; and the comma is used between the
last two members of the series, conjunction or no
conjunction. Thus: “Burns, Barnes of Dorsetshire,
and Riley are poets of the people.” If the
last comma were omitted, we should seem not to
be considering each man separately. Exceptions:
“little old man,” “fine fat hen,” etc.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A rapid series of independent propositions,
very closely related in sense, may be punctuated
by commas. Thus: “I came, I saw, I conquered.”
This is the only structure in which an independent
statement, not introduced by a conjunction, is ever
pointed with the comma. If there is any doubt
whether or not the series is rapid enough to admit
commas, semicolons should be used instead.</p>

<p>5. Relative clauses not restrictive<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> are set off by
commas. This is a rather important rule. If I
say, “The moon, which, as everybody is aware, goes
round the earth, is cold,” the <i>which</i> clause does not
so restrict or define the word “moon” that it is
necessary to our understanding what is meant by
“the moon”; the relative clause can be picked out
bodily, and the sentence will still be intelligible.
“The moon is cold,” is clear enough to people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
live on the earth. They understand that the earth’s
moon is meant. But suppose I say, “The moon
which goes round the earth is smaller than one of
Jupiter’s moons”; now the relative clause identifies,
restricts the word “moon”—tells what moon is
meant. The clause forms an integral part of the
subject. It is no longer the moon merely, a thing
that everybody knows about; it is one particular
moon: the-moon-which-goes-round-the-earth. Occasionally
such a clause can be identified by <i>that</i>,
for many writers save this relative for restrictive
clauses.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Copy and punctuate the following
sentences, all of which, except the first, are
from Robert Louis Stevenson. Defend orally your
pointing:—</p>

<p>1. There goes President Harper who is so much
interested in everything that interests students.</p>

<p>2. Marquis I said if you take another step I fire
upon you.</p>

<p>3. In the midst of these imagine that natural
clumsy unintelligent and mirthful animal John.</p>

<p>4. The terms and spirit in which he spoke of
his political beliefs were in our eyes suited to
religious beliefs and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>5. Oh yes I dare say said John.</p>

<p>6. Moy pronounced Moÿ was a pleasant little
village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>7. We were in a large bare apartment adorned
with two allegorical prints of music and painting
and a copy of the law against public drunkenness</p>

<p>8. Now what I like so much in France is the
clear unflinching recognition by everybody of his
own luck</p>

<p>9. If it ever be a good thing to take such despondency
to heart the Miserere is the right music
and a cathedral a fit scene</p>

<p>10. But the sun was already down the air was
chill and we had scarcely a dry stitch between the
pair of us</p>

<p>11. The inn to which we had been recommended
at Quartes was full.</p>

<p>12. Mme. Gilliard set herself to waken the boy
who had come far that day and was peevish and
dazzled by the light.</p>

<p>13. Do you remember the Frenchman who was
put down at Waterloo Station</p>

<p>14. The children who played together to-day by
the Sambre and Oise canal each at his own father’s
threshold when and where might they next meet</p>

<p>15. I began with a remark upon their dog which
had somewhat the look of a pointer</p>

<p>16. The only buildings that had any interest for
us were the hotel and the café</p>

<p>17. Not long after the drums had passed the
café [we] began to grow sleepy and set out for the
hotel which was only a door or two away</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3><b>The Semicolon.</b></h3>

<p>1. The semicolon is a kind of weak full-stop, <i>i.e.</i>
period. Nearly always it separates clauses that
are grammatically able to get along without each
other, but that are closely related in sense. So
rare indeed are the cases in which the semicolon
may be used with a dependent clause, that a high
school student may properly ignore them. <i>For the
present, avoid using the semicolon to point a dependent
clause.</i></p>

<p>2. Sometimes the semicolon punctuates a series
of mere phrases. This occurs if some particular
emphasis is desired for them, or if they are too
long to be set off by commas. Example:—</p>

<p>An enormous smoke-stack blocks my view; built
of brick, and massive; blue in the cold winter
mist; glowing like a pillar of fire as soon as the
sunlight reaches it; the most changing, the most
stable, thing is this landscape.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Which statements in the following
sentences are independent? which dependent?
(It need hardly be suggested that the necessity of
understanding a subject or a predicate does not
make a statement dependent.)</p>

<p>1. If the sky falls, we shall catch larks.</p>

<p>2. Faults are thick, where love is thin.</p>

<p>3. Happy is he that is happy in his children.</p>

<p>4. Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mathematics, subtile; natural philosophy, deep;
morals, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend.</p>

<p>5. O, there be players that I have seen play,—and
heard others praise, and that highly—not to
speak it profanely, that neither having the accent
of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor
man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have
thought some of nature’s journeymen had made
men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity
so abominably.—<i>Hamlet</i>, Act III. Sc. 2.</p>

<p>The following sentences were written by a pupil
in the first year of the high school. If there are
mistakes in punctuation, explain what principle is
violated:—</p>

<p>1. When the time came to retire; my uncle was
shown to the tower-room.</p>

<p>2. A short time afterward when he was travelling
through Normandy; he came to an old castle
standing in the midst of a park.</p>

<p>3. The postilion was ordered to drive to the
castle; where my uncle received a welcome from
the little Marquis.</p>

<p>4. This seemed the very night for ghosts; with
the wind howling outside and whistling through
the ill-fitting casement.</p>

<h3><b>The Colon.</b></h3>

<p>1. The colon is usually a mark of specification.
Thus, “The old idea of education was simple:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
reading, writing, arithmetic.” A fine distinction
of logic can be shown by using it: a general statement
may be followed by a colon, after which the
details that explain the statement may be given.
In the following sentence the colon <i>specifies</i> what
is meant by fine character. “He was a fellow of
fine character: brave, honorable, free from false
pretense.” Usually the colon separates clauses
that are logically, if not grammatically, in <i>apposition</i>
with each other.</p>

<p>2. The colon introduces a formal or long, the
comma an informal or short, quotation. “He
answered, ‘I will work while the day lasts.’”
“The Declaration of Independence begins as follows:
‘When, in the course of human events.’”</p>

<h3><b>The Dash.</b></h3>

<p>1. The dash shows a sudden break in the thought.
Thus: “We were hurrying onward—but first let
me tell what happened before that.”</p>

<p>2. The dash sometimes precedes a <i>summing up</i>.
Here it usually follows a comma, since the members
of the series are set off by commas: “Chaucer,
Shakespeare, Wordsworth,—very many of our great
poets indeed, were at home in the country.” Sometimes
the dash is used when there is no real summing
up, but an appositive phrase is added, as a further
explanation. For an example, see the last sentence
of the next paragraph,—and this sentence also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The dash, like the comma, is often used to set
off a parenthetical expression. (See 2, under the
comma.) Examples: “His father—that iron gentleman—had
long ago dethroned himself.” “He
was a man—the reader must already have perceived—of
easy, not to say familiar, manners.”
Note that in these examples no commas are used
with the dashes, because if the parenthetical words
were lifted out, the sentence would close up without
punctuation. But suppose the sentence were such
that it could not close up without punctuation; then
the comma would be needed. The comma in “His
father being angry, he felt afraid,” remains when
the parenthesis is inserted: “His father being
angry,—that iron gentleman,—he felt afraid.”
Note that in such a case a second comma is used,—with
the second dash.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Copy and punctuate the
following sentences from Stevenson. In the first
is there not a choice of punctuation after “difficulties”?</p>

<p>1. All the way down we had our fill of difficulties
sometimes it was a wear which could be shot sometimes
one so shallow and full of stakes that we
must withdraw the boats from the water and carry
them round</p>

<p>2. But this is a fashion I love to kiss the hand
or wave a handkerchief to people I shall never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
again to play with possibility and knock in a peg
for fancy to hang upon</p>

<p>3. You see what it is to be a gentleman I beg
your pardon what it is to be a pedler.</p>

<p>4. Centralization said he but the landlord was at
his throat in a minute</p>

<p>5. There should be some myth but if there is I
know it not founded on the shivering of the reeds
there are not many things in nature more striking
to man’s eye</p>

<p>6. “The fire should have been here at this side”
explained the husband “then one might have a
writing table in the middle books and” comprehensively<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
“all it would be quite coquettish <i>ça serait
tout-à-fait coquet</i>.”</p>

<h3><b>Quotation Marks.</b></h3>

<p>1. Marks of quotation, or, as the English call
them, inverted commas, are placed around direct
quotations. Many students neglect a part of this
little duty: they fail to mark <i>the end</i> of the quotation.</p>

<p>2. A quotation within a quotation stands between
single commas. Thus: “We were gathered on
shore, watching the schooner. Gray spoke up:
‘She’s certainly going down, and we must let the
saving station know it. Maybe the patrol has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
already seen her; I saw a sailor walking on the
beach not long since, and singing, “Yeave ho, my
lads, the wind blows free.”’” Note that when
there is a quotation <i>within the second quotation</i>, it
receives the double marks.</p>

<p>3. Sometimes a quotation is given in substance,
with no attempt at accuracy; to show this fact
it is quoted in single commas. Thus: ‘A foolish
consistency frightens little minds.’ This is the
substance of Emerson’s remark, “A foolish consistency
is the bugbear of little minds.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Write a dialogue a page or two long.
Show the change from speaker to speaker by the
use of quotation marks and paragraphing. Each
reply of each interlocutor, with its word or two of
introduction, if such there be, should go by itself
as a paragraph. Choose your own topic; or take
one of these, changing the wording: (1) Smith
tries to make Brown see the difference between
relative clauses restrictive and those merely coördinate.
(2) Two girls lament the difficulties of
punctuation. (3) Two lads [or, men] talk politics.
Do not begin each speech as in Shakespeare each is
begun—with the speaker’s name. Refer occasionally
to the speakers, if you please, <i>e.g.</i>, “‘Not by
any means,’ responded Bangs, rather tartly”; but
do not hesitate to let most of the speeches stand
without comment. Punctuate the dialogue carefully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as you write. Then revise it carefully for
punctuation.</p>

<h3><b>Brackets.</b></h3>

<p>Brackets indicate that the included
matter is inserted by another person than the original
author; that is, by a person who is quoting or
editing the passage. Thus: “He [Goethe] tells
us that character is developed in the busy world,
though intellect is developed in solitude.”</p>

<h3><b>The Exclamation Point.</b></h3>

<p>1. There is a tendency to punctuate with the period
sentences that are really exclamatory; it is better
to use the exclamation point. Thus: “I am so delighted
to see you!”</p>

<p>It is better still to avoid an excess of exclamatory
sentences, however correctly punctuated.</p>

<p>2. The word <i>oh!</i> should be followed by an exclamation
point or by a comma. This is not the
word <i>O</i>, which is used in direct address—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O thou that rollest above,</div>
<div class="verse">Round as the shield of my fathers,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and to express a wish:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O that I had wings like a dove.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>3. The exclamation point may stand in the midst
of a sentence, at the end of a clause. The mark
is then not followed by a capital letter. Thus: “Is
it possible! is it credible!” exclaimed the Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3><b>The Interrogation Point.</b></h3>

<p>1. Placed in parentheses the interrogation point
questions the accuracy of a statement. Ex.: “It is
in New York (?) that the largest number of exiled
Russians is found.”</p>

<p>2. Like the exclamation mark, the question
mark may stand at the end of a clause, before a
small letter. Thus: “Do you believe it? was the
way he greeted me as I finished reading the letter.”
Or, “Shall we lie here inactive? Shall we plan
nothing? attempt nothing? do nothing?”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Copy and punctuate the following
sentences from Stevenson:—</p>

<p>1. Such a dinner as we were going to eat such
beds as we were to sleep in</p>

<p>2. Where were the boating men of Belgium
where the judge and his good wines and where the
graces of Origny</p>

<p>3. Come back again she cried and all the hills
echoed her</p>

<p>4. All the gold had withered out of the sky and
the balloon had disappeared whither I ask myself;
caught up into the seventh heaven or come safely to
land somewhere in that blue uneven distance into
which the roadway dipped and melted before our eyes</p>

<h3><b>Italics.</b></h3>

<p>1. A good rule for italics is to shun them—that
is, not to use them freely to denote emphasis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Emphasis can be secured by some other means;
for instance, by putting the emphatic word near
the beginning of the sentence. Thus: “It was
such a very <i>fine</i> thing to spin along over the ice”
becomes, “A fine thing it was, to spin along over
the ice.”</p>

<p>2. Use italics to show that a word is foreign.
Thus: “Sophronia likes to interlard her English
with such fine phrases as <i>en passant</i>, <i>fin de siècle</i>,
and <i>al fresco</i>.”</p>

<p>3. It is usual to italicize single words if they are
specified,—spoken of as words. Thus: “A good
many words that pass muster with most people are
not really in good use; for example, <i>burglarize</i>.”</p>

<h3><b>The Apostrophe.</b></h3>

<p>1. One use of the apostrophe is to mark the
plural of single letters, or figures. Ex.: Distinguish
between your 8’s and 3’s; dot your <i>i’s</i> and
cross your <i>t’s</i>.</p>

<p>2. The commoner use of the apostrophe is to
mark the possessive case. There is however no
apostrophe in the word <i>its</i>, which is considered an
adjective, not a personal, pronoun.</p>

<h3><b>Asterisks.</b></h3>

<p>A row of asterisks is used to show
an omission. Thus, if a writer were quoting, and
wished to skip a page or two, he would insert this
sign * * * * But if he omitted only a few
words, he would rather use “leaders”; thus....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise, in Review.</b>—Read this passage
over carefully, and listen to the reading of it aloud
by some member of the class or by the instructor.

awfully at the ostler for not bringing him a fresh
team of horses the lawyer inside had generally
his wits about him even when asleep the first
thing he did after learning the cause of the excitement
was to produce a large red pocket-book
meantime Dominicus Pike being an extremely
polite young man and also suspecting that a female
tongue would tell the story as glibly as a lawyer’s
had handed the lady out of the coach she was a fine
smart girl now wide awake and bright as a button
and had such a sweet pretty mouth that Dominicus
would almost as lieves have heard a love tale from
it as a tale of murder</p>

<p>Gentleman and ladies said the lawyer to the

more probably a wilful falsehood maliciously contrived
to injure Mr Higginbotham’s credit has excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
this singular uproar we passed through
Kimballton at three o’clock this morning and most
certainly should have been informed of the murder

as strong as Mr. Higginbotham’s own oral testimony
in the negative here is a note relating to a
suit of his in the Connecticut courts which was
delivered me from that gentleman himself I find
it dated at ten o’clock last evening</p>

<p>So saying the lawyer exhibited the date and
signature of the note which irrefragably proved
either that this perverse Mr. Higginbotham was
alive when he wrote it or as some deemed the more
probable case of two doubtful ones that he was
so absorbed in worldly business as to continue to
transact it even after his death but unexpected
evidence was forthcoming the young lady after

<span class="smaller">GRAMMATICAL PHASES OF WRITING ENGLISH</span></h2>

<p>The present chapter reviews only those grammatical
principles that are sometimes violated by
students who have had a year of formal grammar.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Clearness.</b>—If composition is the art of communicating
one’s ideas in words, it is certain that
clearness is the first requisite of good writing.
Clearness, perfect intelligibility, is secured by
means innumerable. One secret however of being
clear is to regard grammatical usages. If a man is
to be understood exactly, he must be grammatical.
No one is excepted. “Grammar,” said Molière,
“knows how to lord it even over kings.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Ambiguity.</b>—When an expression is open to two
interpretations, it is said to be ambiguous. In the
sentence, “He is a fair man,” <i>fair</i> is an ambiguous
word. In the sentence, “He was arrested by two
officers, who were about to board a West Madison
street car, in possession of a large amount of stolen
property,” the phrase <i>in possession</i>, etc., holds an
ambiguous position. Grammatical errors often produce
this fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Solecisms.</b>—Infringements of grammatical rules
are called <i>solecisms</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Never losing sight of the
fact that writing English is largely the art of telling
some one else just what one means, let us note
a few solecisms that hinder a writer from giving
his exact meaning.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Coherence by placing Modifiers rightly.</b>—I. The
rhetorics are fond of quoting droll sentences in
which, from being wrongly placed, ideas fail to
<i>cohere</i>, stick together. A favorite sentence is that
from an epitaph in an Ulster churchyard: “Erected
to the memory of John Phillips, accidently shot,
as a mark of affection by his brother.” Mr. Bardeen
(“Sentence-Making”) quotes the following,
which sounds like a manufactured joke, but is
nevertheless to the point. “Is there a gentleman
with one eye named Walker in the club?” “I
don’t know; what was the name of his other
eye?” Another much quoted and startling sentence
reads thus: “In one evening I counted
twenty-seven meteors sitting on my back piazza.”
Remedy the incoherence of these sentences. <i>Put
close together on the paper ideas that belong close
together in the mind.</i> Do not let adverbs and
modifying clauses stray from the thought to which
they belong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—The order of words in the following
sentences should so be changed as to increase
the logical coherence of the thoughts.</p>

<p>1. The tops of the French ships were filled with
riflemen, like those of the enemy’s ships.</p>

<p>2. The killing by Orlando, of the wrestler, was
indirectly due to a plot against his brother, which
Oliver invented.</p>

<p>3. I hardly ever remember to have heard such
music.</p>

<p>4. I never remember to have seen him. [Here it
is better to recast the sentence than to change the
position of <i>never</i>.]</p>

<p>5. The lad managed a bronco pony, very vicious
and dangerous, when only thirteen.</p>

<p>6. Wanted, a hostler to take care of a horse, of
a religious turn of mind.</p>

<p>7. After a brief rest Blondin set out again with
“Tom Sayers,” and accomplished the feat he had
undertaken without a hitch.</p>

<p>This week will see the last times of “The
Rogue’s Comedy,” as next season Mr. Willard will
play the new play of Henry Arthur Jones entitled
“The Physician” exclusively.</p>

<p class="tb">II. <i>Only</i>, and <i>not only</i>, usually belong directly
before the word modified.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Insert <i>only</i> in the proper blank.</p>

<p>1. Browning —— wrote —— a few poems for boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>2. She —— breathed —— the name; but we
heard it.</p>

<p>3. We —— received his letter, —— this morning.</p>

<p>4. He —— gave —— five cents —— to the church.</p>

<p class="tb">III. Avoid the Janus-clause; the Janus-phrase;
the Janus-adverb or adjective. The Latin god
Janus had two faces, one looking back, the other
ahead. Avoid putting a modifier where it becomes
double-faced,—where it may be taken either with
the preceding idea or with the following idea.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—So change the position of the
double-faced modifiers that their allegiance will be
known.</p>

<p>1. There is no doubt that Milton gave Dryden
permission to paraphrase Paradise Lost; Dryden
did imitate Milton as a matter of fact not very
cleverly.</p>

<p>2. There can be no doubt that he quarrelled,—that
he fought indeed vigorously. He reappeared
at least with a black eye.</p>

<p>3. She will sing in any case charmingly; her
training has been admirable.</p>

<p>4. As Hazlitt says, in his book of English proverbs,
where no fault is, there needs no pardon.</p>

<p>IV. Avoid putting an adverb between the parts of
an infinitive,—between the <i>to</i> and the verb. Some
reputable writers approve this construction; still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the better order is to place the modifier before or
after the whole infinitive. “Clearly to see,” or
“To see clearly,” is better than “To clearly see.”
This error is called the <i>cleft infinitive</i>.</p>

<h3><b>Concord of Subject and Predicate.</b></h3>

<p>1. A collective noun takes a singular verb if the
group of objects is thought of as a whole: “The
United States is coining gold and silver.” The
collective noun takes a plural verb if each separate
member of the group is thought of: “The United
States are firmly bound together in one union.”</p>

<p>2. When two subject nouns are so closely related
in thought that they seem to mean one thing, the
verb is in the singular: “His courage and bravery
is well approved.”</p>

<p>3. In writing a long sentence, glance back at the
number of the subject before you write the verb.
A plural near the verb often leads one to forget
that the subject is singular. Thus: “The great
number of the crows that settle nightly in the
grove and fill the air with their cries, makes [not
<i>make</i>] the place a bedlam.”</p>

<p>4. When a singular subject precedes a parenthetical
phrase, the former reaches over the head
of the latter, and makes the verb singular. This
rule holds even when the parenthesis is introduced
by <i>with</i>. Thus: “Napoleon, with all his
army, was on the march.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>Either</i>, <i>neither</i>, when used as distributive conjunctions,
take a singular verb. Mr. Carpenter<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
gives this instance of the error: “Neither Senators
Dawes nor Hoar were in their seats to-day.” How
shall the sentence be changed to distribute the
senators properly?</p>

<p>6. If two subjects connected by <i>either—or</i>, etc.,
differ in person, it is possible to make the verb
agree with the subject nearest; as “Neither she
nor you are to blame in this; either I or he is to
blame.” But this construction is awkward. Avoid
the difference in person, or else say, “Neither she
is to blame, nor are you; either he is to blame, or
I am.”</p>

<p>7. <i>Each</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, when used as
pronouns, always take a singular verb. “Each of
us knows; neither of us is ignorant.”</p>

<p>8. <i>None</i> takes either a singular or a plural verb.
It is originally <i>no one</i>, and many careful writers
prefer to keep the singular with it.</p>

<h3><b>Concord of Adjective (or Participle) and Noun.</b></h3>

<p>1. There is an old phrase, <i>these kind</i>, which,
though permitted a century ago, was essentially
ungrammatical, and is not allowed to-day. Say,
<i>this kind</i>, <i>that kind</i>, etc.</p>

<p>2. (<i>a</i>) Every participle, like every adjective,
must agree with its noun in person and number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
But furthermore, every participle has an indisputable
right to have something to agree with. Too
often the poor word is left dangling in mid air.
<i>Shun the unrelated participle and the misrelated participle.</i>
The best of us are only too prone to such
slips as this: “Coming up stairs, it was seen that
the great window fell,” instead of, “Coming up
stairs, we saw the great window fall.” Or this:
“Coming up stairs, the window fell on him,”
where the <i>coming</i> may belong to the <i>window</i> or to
the <i>him</i>. In the first of the two incorrect sentences
the participle is unrelated; in the second it is
misrelated, or at least ambiguously related.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Care should be taken not to use a participle
when a verbal noun in <i>ing</i> is needed. “The fact
of <i>Poe being</i> intemperate should not blind us to the
fact of his genius,” is wrong for “The fact of <i>Poe’s
being</i> intemperate,” etc.</p>

<p>3. Particularly avoid a singular adjective with
a plural noun, in such expressions as, “A long
way” [not <i>ways</i>]. Note here that <i>sidewise</i>, not
<i>sideways</i>, is correct.</p>

<h3><b>Concord of Pronoun and Antecedent.</b></h3>

<p>1. It should be remembered that every singular
antecedent takes a singular pronoun. “Everybody
came forward and laid <i>his</i> contribution on the
table”—not “<i>their</i> contribution.”</p>

<p>2. Before writing the verb of a relative clause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
think whether the antecedent is singular or plural.
“Her voice is one of the sweetest that have [not
<i>has</i>] been heard in this town.”</p>

<p>3. When a number of persons, men and women,
are spoken of distributively, the pronouns <i>he</i> and
<i>his</i> are proper forms of reference—not <i>their</i>, not
<i>his or her</i>. “The audience rose and each person
waved <i>his</i> applause” would be correct, even if
there were ten ladies to each man. The <i>he</i> or <i>his</i>
may here be called the <i>neutral</i> pronoun. What
pronouns should fill the blanks in the following
sentence? “Let every man and woman who would
like to join our picnic betake —— to the pier at
three o’clock, and give —— no anxiety about ——
lunch; —— will find plenty of sandwiches and
cake and coffee on the picnic-boat.”</p>

<p>Such expressions as “every man and woman”
are however undesirable whenever the neutral
pronoun is to be used. A neutral antecedent, like
<i>every person</i>, <i>everybody</i>, <i>every one</i>, is preferable.</p>

<p>4. When the indefinite pronoun <i>one</i> is used,
there is often ambiguity in referring to it later
by <i>he</i>, <i>his</i>, etc. Repeat the <i>one</i>. Thus, “One does
not always know one’s own mind.” Better still,
use an expression like the indefinite <i>you</i>, or, <i>a
person</i>, which has its own representative among
the pronouns. Thus, “A person doesn’t always
know his own mind.”</p>

<p>5. Use sparingly, if at all, the Latin construction—<i>which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fact</i>, <i>which idea</i>, etc. Say rather, <i>a fact
which</i>, etc. E.g. “He was slightly deaf, <i>a misfortune
which</i> he bore without whimpering.”</p>

<p>6. Avoid the Latin construction that makes <i>which</i>
refer to the idea of a whole clause; it is a clumsy
fashion. Example, “He said that he always doted
on Shakespeare—<i>which</i> I, for one, didn’t believe,
because I know the fellow.” There is nothing here
for <i>which</i> to tie to; it is a relative without anything
to which to relate. Rather a better way is to
discard the relative clause, substituting <i>and</i> with a
demonstrative. Thus, “He bowed politely, <i>which</i>
set us all at ease,” becomes, “He bowed politely,
<i>and this</i> set us all at ease.” The <i>this</i> is allowed by
our idiom to refer to the clause, though the construction
is still vague. It is best to hunt up a
good synonym for the idea of the preceding clause:
“He bowed politely, and this <i>courtesy</i> set us all at
ease.” But it is not necessary to discard the relative
clause. A little ingenuity will enable one to
find and insert just before the relative an appositive
to the clause. Into each of the following
sentences slip an appropriate appositive chosen
from the following list: <i>a fact</i>, <i>an idea</i>, <i>a task</i>, <i>a
statement</i>, <i>an assertion</i>, <i>a notion</i>, <i>an excuse</i>, <i>a fancy</i>,
<i>a belief</i>, <i>a hyperbole</i>, <i>a prevarication</i>, <i>a remedy</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Mr. Ignatius Donnelly thinks that Bacon
wrote Shakespeare, —— which ought not to bother
the student who likes Romeo and Juliet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Mame told father that there were a thousand
cats in the back yard, —— which, according to
father, meant our cat and another.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) He has undertaken to learn two hard lessons
in one hour, —— which will probably prove too
much for the lad.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) He proposes to cut the hand off, —— which
seems rather cruel.</p>

<h3><b>Concord of Cases.</b></h3>

<p>Subject and complement of an intransitive verb
agree in case.</p>

<p>1. The complement of an intransitive verb in a
finite mode is in the nominative case. “It’s I”
[not <i>me</i>]. “I am he.” “I thought it was he.”</p>

<p>2. If the subject of an infinitive is in the objective
case, the complement is in the same case.
“I thought it to be him” [not <i>he</i>]. But, “It was
thought to be he.”</p>

<h3><b>Concord of Tenses.</b></h3>

<p>1. In writing the verb of a subordinate clause,
be sure that its tense shall show just what you wish
it to show—whether the <i>same</i> time as that of the
principal verb, or <i>earlier</i> time, or <i>later</i> time. For
example:—</p>

<p><i>The same time.</i>—“He did not think himself to
be much of a poet.”</p>

<p><i>Earlier time.</i>—“He did not think that he had
been much of a poet.” “He was sorry not to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
been much of a poet.” “Yesterday, when John
spoke of the matter, I should have liked to have
had some experience that I might have used in
advising him.”</p>

<p><i>Later time.</i>—“I wanted to go” [not <i>to have
gone</i>]. “I had intended to go.” “I should have
liked to go.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Correct the errors in concord of
tenses, explaining each emendation.</p>

<p>1. Where did you say St. Peter’s was?</p>

<p>2. Is it warm out of doors? I should say it was.</p>

<p>3. I fully intended to have met you at the
concert.</p>

<h3><b>Government.</b></h3>

<p>1. “He invited him and <i>I</i>,” is not an unheard-of
blunder. People often needlessly shrink from
saying a correct sentence like this—“He invited
him and me”—and will even insert the full
names of <i>him</i> and <i>me</i> rather than out with the
right case of the pronoun.</p>

<p>2. In asking a question, think whether <i>who</i> or
<i>whom</i> is required. “<i>Whom</i> did you see?” but,
“<i>Who</i> was it that you saw?”</p>

<p>3. <i>Let</i> governs the objective case, quite as any
other active verb. “Let John and me go.”</p>

<p>4. An error often occurs in the case of the
relative after a verb of saying, thinking, telling,
and the like. “Franklin’s Autobiography is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
work of a man <i>whom</i> I should think would be
known to every American.” The <i>whom</i> is wrong
for <i>who</i>. Had the writer set off “I should think”
by commas, he would have seen the mistake.</p>

<p>5. How should the following newspaper sentence
be corrected? “He stated that the offering
was $101,500, an amount upon which he would
stake his honor would all be paid up.”</p>

<h3><b>On the Reference of Pronouns.</b></h3>

<p>1. In the use of pronouns one cannot be too careful
that each refers to the right person. “Farmer
Jones called on his neighbor and told him that
his cows were in his pasture,” leaves us in doubt
whether Farmer Jones came to make a complaint
or an apology. How should the sentence be constructed
to remove the ambiguity? The following
delicious error has been much quoted: “If fresh
milk does not seem to agree with the child, boil
it.” How change the sentence to save the child’s
life?</p>

<p>2. Sometimes a demonstrative can be used to
better advantage than a personal pronoun. “They
lent us their horses for the afternoon and these
[not <i>they</i>] took us a long way out into the country.”</p>

<p>3. Sometimes it is better to repeat the antecedent,
varying it by simple synonyms, than to use
any pronoun. Not, “He gave him his word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
honor, that whenever he should see his brother
in London, he would do all for him that he ought
to do for an old comrade’s brother.” Rather thus:
“He gave his friend his word of honor, that whenever
he should see the latter’s brother in London,
he would do for the boy all that a man ought to
do for the brother of an old comrade.”</p>

<p>4. Acquire a habit of writing, “It is he,” or “It’s
he,” instead of “He is the one.” This latter phrase
is permissible in colloquial speech, where its clumsiness
is not much felt. The correct expression may
sometimes seem over-precise. But a person of tact
ought to be able to speak correctly without seeming
affected.</p>

<h3><b>Conjunctions and Prepositions.</b></h3>

<p>1. Shall we say “as large as,” “not as large as,”
etc.? The first expression is right. But after a negative,
use <i>so</i> for a correlative to <i>as</i>: “not <i>so</i> large as.”</p>

<p>2. In general be careful not to omit necessary
conjunctions. What should be supplied in the following
sentence? and how should the order be
changed? “Henty is better known but not so
interesting to older boys as Stevenson.”</p>

<p>3. <i>And which</i>, <i>and who</i>, etc., are wrong for <i>which</i>,
<i>who</i>, etc., when no relative has previously been
used. Correct the following: “Irving, the historian,

<p>4. <i>Like</i> is not a conjunction. It is incorrect
to say, “Do like I do.” This wrong use of <i>like</i>
is habitual in many parts of our country, and a
native of any one of these districts has to watch
himself narrowly to acquire the habit of using <i>as</i>
for <i>like</i>. It is, however, correct enough to say,
“She talks <i>like him</i>.” Here <i>like</i> is an adjective
governing what was the dative case, and the phrase
<i>like him</i> has the value of an adverb.</p>

<p>5. <i>Different to</i> is wrong for <i>different from</i>. This
error, though rarely to be found in America,
is habitual in England. The commoner American
error is <i>different than</i>. This mistake frequently
occurs when the comparative degree has previously
been used. <i>E.g.</i> “This last kind of apple
is different and sweeter than the first.” The better
form is: “This last kind of apple is different from
the first, and sweeter.” <i>Do not split the particles</i>,
by saying, “This kind of apple is different from
and sweeter than the first.”</p>

<h3><b>Adverb or Adjective?</b></h3>

<p>1. There is a group of words—verbs of sensation
and the like, <i>look</i>, <i>sound</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>appear</i>,
<i>seem</i>—which take an adjective to complete
their meaning. “She looks <i>sweet</i>,” “It tastes
<i>sweet</i>,” “She <i>seems</i> happy,” are common and correct
ways of speaking. <i>Notice that here something
of the same idea can be given by saying</i>, “She <i>is</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sweet,” “It <i>is</i> sweet,” “She <i>is</i> happy.” The
<i>sweet</i> idea or the <i>happy</i> idea describes the subject,
the person, not the verb. Of course, one might
write a sentence in which the <i>sweet</i> idea would
tell the way a given act was done. “She looked
sweetly” would imply that she was gazing sweetly
at something or somebody.</p>

<p>But here must be noted an exception or two.
(<i>a</i>) The word <i>bad</i> has two senses: moral badness,
and badness that is not moral—badness of health,
for instance. If I say “I feel bad,” the bad seems
to mean moral badness: <i>i.e.</i> “I <i>am</i> bad.” It is
therefore permissible to break the rule and apply
<i>badly</i> to physical feeling. “I feel badly” is a
common expression for “I feel sick”; and by the
exception to the rule is correct. Which is better
in the following sentence—<i>bad</i> or <i>badly</i>? “It
sounds —— to hear a young man swear.” (<i>b</i>) There
are a few cases where the adverb is retained
when the verb is not felt as acting. “The report
sounds well,” certainly does not mean that the
report is in good health; but it is certainly good
English. Similarly we have: “She appears well
in company.”</p>

<p>It is to be kept in mind that <i>ill</i> and <i>well</i>
are not always adverbs. They are often adjectives;
and if one says “I feel ill,” or “I feel
well,” one is using the adjective <i>ill</i> or the adjective
<i>well</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Shall or Will.</b>—Most Americans, like most Scotchmen,
use the word <i>will</i> too frequently, to the neglect
of <i>shall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shall</i> is from Old English <i>sceal</i> (skayʹ-al) and
once meant <i>owe</i>, <i>be obliged</i>. It still may mean the
same thing, when not used as a mere auxiliary.
That is, <i>should</i> often means <i>ought</i>, which was once
the past tense of <i>owe</i>. It still can mean “to
be obliged.” “You shall,” “he shall,” are expressions
that imply obligation, imposed by the
speaker. “I shall at last die” still has in it the
idea of being compelled. But this phrase illustrates
happily one way by which <i>shall</i> with the first
person has come to be felt as a mere future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Nearly always to-day <i>I shall</i> names a voluntary act;
but the volition is usually not emphasized; the
speaker has usually made up his mind before he
says <i>I shall</i>, and the words simply foretell the
future act. “I shall be there” incidentally announces
the speaker’s intention, but the chief thing
it announces is that the speaker will <i>be there</i>. It is
probably the future fact that is of interest to his
friends. <i>Ordinarily, therefore</i>, shall <i>in the first person
means futurity more than it means volition.</i></p>

<p><i>Will</i> is from <i>wilian</i> (wilʹ-yan), meaning <i>to wish</i>, <i>to
will</i>. It frequently means that to-day, though in
the second and third persons it is also used for
the simple future. “I will” always implies volition.
I will <i>implies either deliberate intention, distinct
wish, or distinct willingness</i>. “I will go”
means “I am determined to go,” or, “I wish to
go,” or, “I am willing to go.” Frequently such a
phrase implies that there is opposition or an obstacle.
“You will,” “they will,” usually lack the
volitive idea; they simply foretell that which <i>you</i>,
<i>they</i>, are about to do. Yet <i>you will</i>, <i>he will</i>, <i>they will</i>
may still mean <i>you are determined</i>, etc., if applied
to a being that has the power of choice. Here one
has but to emphasize the <i>will</i>, and the old meaning
is brought back. Thus: “He <i>will</i> persist in doing
so, though all his friends deplore it.”</p>

<p>Our first rule will accordingly be as follows: <i>To
indicate mere futurity, use <span class="antiqua">shall</span> in the first person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<span class="antiqua">will</span> in the second and third.</i> Examples: “I shall
be glad to come. You and the others will find me
on hand at the pier.” So far, so good. But note that
this rule also applies when the speaker is made to
report his own words in indirect narrative. “Abner
<i>says</i> that he <i>shall</i> be glad to come, and that you
and the others <i>will</i> find him on hand at the pier.”
Just so if the indirect discourse is in the <i>past</i>, and
it is still the speaker who reports his own words.
“Abner <i>said</i> that he <i>should</i> be glad to come, and
that you and the others <i>would</i> find him at the
pier.” All this seems sensible enough, for the
speaker is merely made to foretell his own future
act. The rule is too often broken. “Abner said
he was afraid he’d miss the boat.” Here the contraction
<i>he’d</i> stands (as always) for <i>he would</i>, a
form that is wrong in this place for <i>he should</i>.</p>

<p>The same rule applies when the indirect narrative
is merely implied; that is, when instead of
such a word as <i>say</i> we have <i>think</i>, or <i>fear</i>, or <i>believe</i>.
“Luke thinks he <i>shall</i> miss his boat,” is
correct; so is, “Luke feared he <i>should</i> miss the
boat.”</p>

<p>Suppose, now, it is no longer what Luke said about
his own future act, but what somebody else said
about it. “Evarts remarked that Luke was ready
and <i>would</i> hurry to the pier; but Evarts feared that
Luke <i>would</i> miss the boat.” The <i>shall</i> gives place
naturally enough to <i>will</i>. <i>After verbs of saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
thinking, telling, and the like, <span class="antiqua">shall</span> (or <span class="antiqua">should</span>) is the
proper auxiliary if the future act is foretold by the actor.</i></p>

<p>Now we are ready to ask how these words should
be used in questions. A very simple rule is enough
for most purposes: <i>In the second and third persons,
use in the question the form you expect in the answer.</i></p>

<p>“Shall you be at the pier by three, Abner?”
Abner replies, “I certainly shall.” “Will you
kindly bring my lunch with you? the cook has it
ready.” “I will, with great pleasure.”</p>

<p>The rule holds when applied to indirect discourse.
Thus: “Abner’s aunt asked him whether
he <i>should</i> be at the pier by three. Abner replied
that he <i>should</i>. Then she wanted to know if he
<i>would</i> kindly bring her lunch along; Abner promised
that he <i>would</i>.”</p>

<p>If a question is put in the first person, <i>shall</i> often
asks for instructions. “<i>Shall</i> I go?” But if
mere information is asked, <i>shall</i> is still the form:
“<i>Shall</i> I be required to do all this?” “Yes, I fear
you will.” Briefly, then, <i>for a question in the first
person always use</i> shall.</p>

<h3><b>Matters of Etymology.</b></h3>

<p>1. Good usage recommends that we say “the
schools of Chicago” rather than “Chicago’s
schools”; “the cause of the accident” rather than
“the accident’s cause.” In other words, it recommends
that we save the possessive in <i>’s</i> (or Saxon
genitive) for living beings. For things, for abstract
ideas, for cities—everything except beings—the
possessive in <i>of</i> (or Norman genitive) is preferred.
Thus we say, “Napoleon’s hat,” and “the rim of
Napoleon’s hat,” instead of “Napoleon’s hat’s rim.”
The newspapers, perhaps to save space, have fallen
into the habit of talking about “Chicago’s interests,”
“Evanston’s water-works,” “America’s navy,”
etc.; but it is better not to imitate these expressions.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Such matters are matters, not of right and
wrong, but of better and worse.</p>

<p>2. While <i>got</i> is usually better than <i>gotten</i> as a
past participle, the two words have, in one case,
different meanings. “I have got my lesson” is
perhaps preferable to “I have gotten my lesson.”
But “I have got to be a scholar” means, “I must be
a scholar”; while, “I have gotten to be a scholar”
is, well,—perhaps a boast.</p>

<p>3. Good use prescribes <i>he drank</i>, but <i>he has drunk</i>
[not, <i>he has drank</i>].</p>

<p>4. <i>Anybody else’s</i>, or <i>anybody’s else</i>—which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in better use? For most places, the former.
Thus: “Anybody else’s dog would have been
shot for his sheep-stealing.” But <i>anybody’s else</i>
is often preferable at the end of the clause or
sentence. Thus: “If the dog had been anybody
else’s it would have been shot; unfortunately
it was nobody’s else.” The distinction has ceased
to be a matter of logic, and become a matter of
euphony. Of course, <i>else</i> is strictly an adjective,
and might seem to be exempt from the possessive
case. But adjectives have always had a way of
growing fast to nouns and becoming part of them:
<i>e.g.</i> sweetbriar, Redfern, Goodman. Though <i>else</i>
is not written as a part of the noun <i>anybody</i> (which
is already long enough), it is often felt as a part
of the noun. What you <i>think</i> is not always <i>anybody
+ else</i>; it is often, <i>anybodyelse</i>. As a matter
of fact, the word <i>anybody</i> itself is really two words
grown together till we do not think of them as
adjective + noun.</p>

<p>1. Tom’s nurse was one who took in her instruction
very slowly—she seemed to have two left
hands and no head; and so Mrs. Brown kept her
on longer than usual, that [she, the girl] might
expend her awkwardness and forgetfulness upon
those who would not judge and punish [her, the

<p>2. It had been the immemorial habit of the village
[either] to [either] christen children [either]
by Bible names or [by] those of the cardinal and
other virtues.</p>

<p>3. He was a hearty, strong boy from the first,
given to fighting [with and escaping from his

fraternizing with all [of] the village boys, with
whom he made expeditions all around the neighborhood.</p>

the Browns are, [at least] my branch of them [at
least]; and then if you don’t like the sort, why
cut the concern at once, and let you and [I, me]
cry quits before either of us can grumble at the
other.</p>

<p>5. For a short time after a boy has taken up
[such] a life [as, like] Arnold would have urged
upon him, he has a hard time of it. He finds his
judgment often at fault, his body and intellect running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

præpostors [stay, stays] by the door to watch for
truants of their side; there is <i>carte blanche</i> to the

<p>13. [It was he, He was the one] who bent the
first pin with which Tom extracted his first stickleback
out of [“Pebbly Brook,”] the little stream
which ran through the village, [“Pebbly Brook”].
The first stickleback was a splendid fellow, with
fabulous red and blue gills. Tom kept him in a
small basin till the day of [his, the fish’s] death,
and became a fisherman from that day.</p>

<p>14. His nurse told him that those good-natured
looking women were in the constant habit of enticing
children into the barges and taking [them,
these] up to London and selling them, [which, a
story which] Tom wouldn’t believe.</p>

mostly of aluminum.</p>

<p>13. When I go back to Cuba again I should like
to go with 10,000 interpreters instead of one, all in

<p>14. Passing a field where brother David was sowing
rye, several merry voices called out, “How are

<p>16. Eva picked up the letter from the hall table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
looked quickly round at the closed hall door, at the
closed dining-room door, and at the baize door that
led to the kitchen stairs—and kissed it.</p>

<p>17. Talking the other day with a friend (the late
Mr. Keats) about Dante, he observed that whenever
so great a poet told us anything in addition or continuation

<p>18. Alcibiades told the Spartan envoys that if
they would say to the Athenians that their power
was limited and that they could only listen and
then tell the Spartans what they heard that he
would see that the Athenians did not join the
alliance: so when the ambassadors went there they
did as Alcibiades said and Alcibiades got up and
said, that they could not tell two things alike and
the Athenians would not have anything more to do
with them and they joined the alliance.</p>

<p>19. Having given this department-store question
much careful thought I have decided a more dangerous
monopoly could not be found, for reasons as
follows: First, they tend to centralize business,
which is dangerous, and should not exist if we
wish our city to grow and thereby equalize taxation.
Second, the continuous advertising of the
entire stock of an unfortunate merchant on sale in
these stores at 33 cents on the dollar is not encouraging
to strangers who visit us.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON DIVIDING A PARAGRAPH INTO SENTENCES</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>The Sentence not its own Master.</b>—Everybody
learns at an early age some such definition as this:
A sentence is the expression of a complete thought
in words. But many students who have just left
the grammar school are not very clear in their own
minds as to what the definition means. When
they come to write sentences they find it hard to
decide what constitutes a complete thought. They
know what the test of grammatical completeness is—the
sentence must have a subject and a predicate;
but they are hazy as to when the sentence
is logically complete. Frankly, the most accomplished
writers are sometimes troubled to decide
this question. Having two ideas, they are not
sure whether these ought to stand in separate
sentences, or in semicolon clauses. There is no
magic rule; but by the right kind of practice one
may become perfectly sure, in nine cases out of
ten, of the best course to take.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way to approach the matter
is to remember that the sentence is only a part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
larger unit,—the paragraph. A paragraph is either
a miniature composition, or a main part of a short
composition. In long works, the <i>chapter</i> is the short
composition of which the paragraphs are the divisions.
The sentence, in turn, is a main part of the
paragraph. Whether a sentence should be long or
short depends on the part it plays in the paragraph.</p>

<p>To make this statement plain, we need consider
only the paragraph that stands alone, a miniature
composition. Whatever be the number of its sentences,
each forms a main part or step in the development
of the paragraph-thought. All are
concerned with <i>explaining</i> the same thing; each
contributes something to the idea. If there is a
topic sentence and this be likened to a root, the
other sentences are like the stalks and leaves which
grow from the root.</p>

<p>Note how each of the following miniature compositions<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
has a root, from which the rest of the
paragraph springs necessarily.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Flowers have an expression of countenance as much
as men or animals. Some seem to smile; some have a sad
expression; some are pensive and diffident; others again
are plain, honest, and upright, like the broad-faced sunflower
and the hollyhock.—<span class="smcap">H. W. Beecher.</span></p>

<p>2. There are three wicks ... to the lamp of a man’s
life; brain, blood, and breath. Press the brain a little, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
light goes out, followed by both the others. Stop the heart
a minute, and out go all three of the wicks. Choke the air
out of the lungs, and presently the fluid ceases to supply the
other centres of flame, and all is soon stagnation, cold, and
darkness.—<span class="smcap">Dr. Holmes.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Consider the parts of the paragraphs just given.
Mr. Beecher has two sentences, the second grouping
together the details which explain the first.
But the first sentence is made much shorter than
the second, because, word for word, it is to be
more emphatic. The second is the longer, because
no one of the separate clauses seemed to the writer
important enough to stand alone. The clauses of
detail taken together form one main division of the
paragraph. The short sentence that states the gist
of the paragraph is another main division. In Dr.
Holmes’s brief parable, there are four sentences.
Three of them develop the general idea stated in
the first. Dr. Holmes cannot condense these three
into one explanatory sentence, as Beecher does;
he has too much to say. By giving a sentence
to each of the three “wicks,” he shows that he
considers them all approximately equal in importance.</p>

<p>Study now another paragraph:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is saying less than the truth to affirm that an excellent
book (and the remark holds almost equally good of a Raphael
as of a Milton) is like a well-chosen and well-tended
fruit tree. Its fruits are not of one season only. With the
due and natural intervals, we may recur to it year after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
year, and it will supply the same nourishment and the same
gratification, if only we ourselves return to it with the same
healthful appetite.—<span class="smcap">Coleridge.</span></p>

</div>

<p>In this passage from Coleridge the first sentence
is the root of the paragraph; ‘a book is like
a fruit tree.’ But the second sentence is made
shorter than the first, because it is to state the pith
of the paragraph more clearly and emphatically
than did the first. The meaning of the first sentence
is a little vague; how a book is like a fruit
tree, it does not say. The second sentence does say
how. Note, then, that a short sentence is always
emphatic, and that accordingly it should be used to
state something that is important in the paragraph.</p>

<p>Study also the following paragraph:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our chief want in life, is somebody who shall make us do
what we can. This is the service of a friend. With him
we are easily great. There is a sublime attraction in him to
whatever virtue is in us. How he flings wide the doors of
existence! What questions we ask of him! what an understanding
we have! how few words are needed! It is the
only real society.—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

</div>

<p>In this paragraph of Emerson’s, the main ideas
are stated in brief sentences, and the summary of
the paragraph comes in a sentence of six short
words. But note that in the last sentence except
one, the writer groups three clauses, because the
three constitute parts of one main idea of the
paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Read the following rather abstruse paragraphs,
and decide as to which shows the chief divisions of
the whole thought.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is, first, the literature
of knowledge; and,
secondly, the literature of
power. The function of the
first is, to teach; the function
of the second is, to
move; the first is a rudder,
the second an oar or a sail.
The first speaks to the mere
discursive understanding;
the second speaks ultimately,
it may happen, to the higher
understanding or reason, but
always through affections of
pleasure and sympathy.—<span class="smcap">De
Quincey.</span></p>

</div>

<p>From a study of the foregoing selections, it
becomes clear that the sentence is not its own
master. It is the servant of the paragraph. The
paragraph, having an idea to give, uses sentences
to develop this idea. A skilful writer is not in
haste to crowd into a sentence all of one large,
complex thought. The full expression of that
thought is the task of the paragraph. The sentences
are the means by which its parts may be
made clear. The long sentences are for explanatory
details; the short ones are for emphatic summaries
or generalizations, and for rapid narrative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Sentence Unity.</b>—I. <i>A sentence that possesses
Unity of Substance constitutes one main step in the
development of the paragraph-idea.</i> A main step, as
thus employed, usually means a sentence giving
one of the following: (1) the general subject of the
paragraph; (2) the general thought or assertion of
the paragraph; (3) the repetition of a preceding
idea in new words; (4) an illustration; (5) a group
of particulars or details; (6) one proof, or term, in a
chain of reasoning; (7) a brief contrast; (8) a cause
and an effect; (9) an assertion and a very brief
illustration. It would be absurd to hold these
principles of unity anxiously in mind when one is
writing. Having thought them over a little, and
taken to heart the general doctrine that the sentence
should be one main step, the scholar should
trust his own sense of unity. The chief value of
any such analysis is that it may help the scholar
to give thought to his own sentences.</p>

<p class="tb">II. <i>A sentence that possesses Unity of Form keeps
one coherent structure throughout, and subordinates
unimportant clauses to the important.</i> Unity of
form does not concern the division of the paragraph
into sentences. It will be considered in Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI.</a>, under Well-knit Sentences.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>I. Unity of Substance by Excluding Irrelevant
Ideas.</b>—Perhaps the first thing that is noticed in
reading hasty composition, is that some sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are too long. Here is one, written by a lad of
fourteen. It will seem to most readers to be a sentence
of infantine simplicity, such as no high school
student is in the slightest danger of perpetrating.
My apology for giving it is that it renders every
heterogeneous sentence ridiculous.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Oliver Orlando’s brother did not like him and when he
heard that Orlando whipped Charles he was very angry and
was going to burn Orlando’s house up with him in it, but
Adam, Orlando’s faithful servant, ran out and told him, so
they got all the money they had and started for the forest
of Arden, when they got pretty near there Adam being so
old fainted from hunger.</p>

</div>

<p>The student who wrote this was not thinking of
the parts of his paragraph; he was thinking merely
of the story of <i>As You Like It</i>. He plunged ahead
after the story, never looking behind him. The
result is a long, rambling sentence, with several
chief thoughts in it. These chief thoughts are
four: (1) Oliver hatefully plots to kill Orlando.
(2) Adam foils Oliver. (3) Adam and Orlando
flee. (4) Adam at last faints. The paragraph
therefore divides into four decent, though childish,
sentences:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Oliver, Orlando’s brother, did not like him; and when he
heard that Orlando whipped Charles he was very angry, and
was going to burn Orlando’s house up with him in it. But
Adam, Orlando’s faithful servant, ran out and told him. So
they got together all the money they had, and started for the
forest of Arden. When they got pretty near there, Adam,
being so old, fainted from hunger.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Periods are now substituted for several of the
student’s commas. That writer had confused these
two marks, the comma and the full stop. Such an
error may be called, for mere convenience, <i>the comma
fault</i>. It is readily seen that of all possible mistakes
in punctuation, the comma fault is the most serious
and elementary. To begin a new sentence after a
comma is an infallible sign of illiteracy.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—In the following passages, correct
the comma fault wherever it appears. Change
the sentences in other ways to give a more mature
tone to them.</p>

<p>1. I don’t know what to do in such a case, it is
too hard to decide. [Change comma to semicolon.]</p>

<p>2. Romeo fell in love at once, he couldn’t help
himself, he had never seen any person so lovable.</p>

<p>3. So they also started for the forest of Arden
disguised as a countryman and woman, when they
got there they bought a house that was to be sold
at auction, once while wandering around they met
Orlando and Rosalind asked him if it was he that
was spoiling the trees by carving love sentences on
them, and he said it was, so she said he could pretend
that she was Rosalind, so he came there every
day until one day he was detained by seeing a lioness
just going to spring on Oliver.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Write a paragraph of six to ten short
sentences. Let the first state the whole event in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
brief. Let the others give the steps of the action
tersely, rapidly, emphatically. Revise for spelling
and punctuation. Suggested topics:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Shooting the rapids.</li>
<li>2. How the water comes down at the falls.</li>
<li>3. How the accident happened.</li>
<li>4. How a log-jam is broken.</li>
<li>5. The way to shoot a glass ball.</li>
<li>6. Down a hill on a wheel.</li>
<li>7. Sights from a car window.</li>
<li>8. A fall on the ice.</li>
<li>9. Shooting the “Chutes.”</li>
<li>10. A runaway.</li>
<li>11. A flash-light photograph.</li>
<li>12. How the bird (or game) escaped.</li>
<li>13. Paul Revere’s ride.</li>
<li>14. An exciting moment.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tb"><b>II. Unity of Substance by Including all the Parts
of an Idea.</b>—It has already been said that a paragraph
may be composed of several very short sentences,
each one a main step of the paragraph,
each one a unit. For example:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A great silence made itself felt. Then, on a sudden, a
dry sound cracked in the air. The viscount had slapped his
adversary’s face. Every one rose to interfere. Cards were
exchanged between the two.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, indeed, it may be that the second and third
sentences are halves of one idea, divided to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
its parts more emphatic. At all events, while a
sentence may be very short and still constitute a
principal factor of the paragraph, sentences should
not be so brief that each is, so to speak, only half
a main thought. A main thought may be composite.
Thus, it is often effective (<i>a</i>) to <i>state</i> and to
<i>explain</i> an idea very briefly, within the one sentence;
(<i>b</i>) to show an extremely close relation of
<i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i>, by stating both within the one
sentence; (<i>c</i>) to <i>contrast</i> two things very briefly
within the one sentence.</p>

<p>Now, a child gives his ideas in mere bits; he
cannot express the relations of the bits to each
other. For example:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My aunt was a very large woman. My uncle was a very
thin man. He was very delicate. He dwindled. I mean,
he got thinner and punier every day. And my aunt thought
a great deal of him. She wished him to get well. She gave
him a great deal of medicine. She gave him so much that
he began to get worse. He finally died.</p>

</div>

<p>This paragraph tells the story of how a woman
doctored her husband to death. The writer has
made eight steps in the story, which perhaps has
not really more than four main parts: (1) The
<i>contrast</i> between my aunt and uncle. (2) My uncle
“dwindled”—<i>explained</i> by saying he got punier
daily. (3) My aunt’s love, and its <i>consequence</i>—her
wish for my uncle’s recovery. (4) The form
the wish took,—giving of medicine. (5) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
twofold result,—aggravation of the disease, then
death.</p>

<p>The original sentences may be combined into
four. In combining them, what pointing shall be
used instead of so many full stops? We may use
commas, but only if we make one clause dependent
or join two clauses or propositions by a conjunction.
We may say, for example, “My aunt was a very
large woman, and my uncle a very thin, delicate
man.” We have inserted an <i>and</i>; this permits the
use of a comma. The result is a pretty good sentence,
having one complex idea,—the contrast
between the ample lady and her slight husband.</p>

<p>But another invaluable means of showing the
real <i>factors</i> of the sentence is the semicolon. The
semicolon, as was said in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III.</a>, is a kind of
weak full stop. Nearly always it connects statements
that are unrelated and independent grammatically,
but intimately related in sense. In a way,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
the semicolon connects sentences, a period separates
sentences. The former sign is priceless to
the writer who, when he comes to expand each
idea of his paragraph, finds the structure growing
too complicated. He has merely to place a semicolon
and go ahead with a miniature new sentence,
which every reader will understand to be a part of
the logical unit in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>If we combine the eight sentences by the help
of the semicolon, we get four, somewhat like the
following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My aunt was a very large woman; my uncle, on the contrary,
was a very thin delicate man. He dwindled; that is,
he got thinner and punier every day. My aunt thought a
good deal of him, and naturally she wished him to get well.
She gave him, accordingly, a great deal of medicine. She
gave him so much indeed that he began to get worse; and,
finally, he died.</p>

</div>

<p>Most students do not use the semicolon enough.
Two or three semicolon clauses, however, are sufficient
for a very long sentence. If more are written
there is usually danger of encroaching upon the
next main thought of the paragraph. <i>It is better to
write too many short sentences than too many long
ones.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Consider the following paragraph,
and decide whether the main thoughts of it are nine,
as here indicated, or four. If four, the thoughts
are: (1) Contrast between light above and dark
below. (2) The growing dark. (3) The faint,
weird sights and sounds that come to the narrator.
(4) His retreat from the abbey. If, having given
the matter careful thought, you think there should
be but four sentences, or if you think there is any
other fault in the punctuation, explain how you
would repoint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The last beams of day were now faintly streaming through
the painted windows in the high vaults above me. The
lower parts of the abbey were already wrapped in the obscurity
of twilight. The chapels and aisles grew darker and
darker. The effigies of the kings faded into shadows. The
marble figures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in
the uncertain light. The evening breeze crept through the
aisles like the cold breath of the grave. And even the distant
footfall of a verger, traversing the Poet’s Corner, had
something strange and dreary in its sound. I slowly retraced
my morning’s walk. And as I passed out at the
portal of the cloisters, the door, closing with a jarring noise
behind me, filled the whole building with echoes.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb"><b>Punctuation for Emphasis.</b>—Below are given three
ways of punctuating the same words. We may suppose
the same words to be used by three different
generals.</p>

<p>1. General A. twirled his moustache, and spoke
softly, in his calm, unruffled way, as if he were
explaining a mathematical problem to a cadet; he
said to the soldier, “You are a coward: you shrink,
you dodge, you hide, you run away when the danger
comes.” He spoke meditatively, and with a
little drawl, letting his voice rise at each pause.</p>

<p>2. General B. looked at the soldier steadily, and
said in a sharp, decided tone: “You are a coward:
you shrink; you dodge; you hide; you run away
when the danger comes.”</p>

<p>3. General C. sprang up from his camp-stool,
angry and indignant. He spoke explosively and
incoherently. “You are a coward! You shrink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
You dodge. You hide. You run away when the
danger comes.”</p>

<p>Evidently the punctuation here is largely dependent
on the different states of mind. A calm,
logical attitude is reflected in the nice distinctions
conveyed by the colon and comma. An excited
mood over-emphasizes each detail, and makes it a
sentence. There is sometimes need of indignant
emphasis on each detail. Perhaps therefore the
strict unity of the sentence may sometimes be
sacrificed for the sake of emphasis. Such a sacrifice
however should very rarely be made.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Consider the following paragraph
as a whole, and decide whether the sentences represent
the main factors of the paragraph-thought.
If you agree that “the song of a young girl’s voice”
is as important in the paragraph as several of the
other songs put together, how can this importance
be indicated by punctuation?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The first thing which Tom saw was the black cedars, high
and sharp against the rosy dawn. And St. Brandan’s Isle
reflected double in the still broad silver sea. The wind sung
softly in the cedars, and the water sung among the caves.
The sea-birds sung as they streamed out into the ocean, and
the land-birds as they built among the boughs. And the
air was so full of song that it stirred St. Brandan and his
hermits, as they slumbered in the shade. And they moved
their good old lips, and sung their good old hymn amid their
dreams. But among all the songs one came across the water
more sweet and clear than all, for it was the song of a young
girl’s voice.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—In the seventeenth century
there were many authors whose minds were full of
Latin models. These writers tried to build up in
English, an uninflected language, sentences as complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as those of Cicero. They tried to make the
sentence do the work of the paragraph. How
utterly they failed may be seen in the following
passages from Defoe and Lord Clarendon. Considering
each selection as a paragraph, rewrite with
reference to unity of substance in the sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. There is one thing more remarkable in this parish, and
it is this: twenty-six sheets of lead, hanging all together,
were blown off from the middle isle of our church, and were
carried over the north isle, which is a very large one, without
touching it; and into the churchyard ten yards’ distance
from the church; and they were took up all joined together
as they were on the roof; the plumber told me that the
sheets weighed each three hundred and a half, one with
another. This is what is most observable in our parish:
but I shall give you an account of one thing (which perhaps
you may have from other hands) that happened in another,
called Kingscote, a little village about three miles from Tedbury,
and seven from us: where William Kingscote, Esq.,
has many woods; among which was one grove of very tall
trees, being each near eighty foot high; the which he greatly
valued for the tallness and prospect of them, and therefore
resolved never to cut them down: but it so happened, that
six hundred of them, within the compass of five acres were
wholly blown down; (and supposed to be much at the same
time) each tree tearing up the ground with its root; so that
the roots of most of the trees, with the turf and earth about

application, and even submission to good and worthy

more evident in his place, which objected him to another
conversation and intermixture than his own election would
have done) <i>adversus malos injucundus</i>; and was so ill a
dissembler of his dislike and disinclination to ill men, that it
was not possible for such not to discern it. There was once,
in the House of Commons, such a declared acceptation of
the good service an eminent member had done to them, and,
as they said, to the whole kingdom, that it was moved, he
being present, “That the speaker might, in the name of the
whole house, give him thanks, and then that every member
might, as a testimony of his particular acknowledgment, stir
or move his hat towards him;” the which (though not
ordered) when very many did, the lord Falkland (who
believed the service itself not to be of that moment, and
that an honourable and generous person could not have
stooped to it for any recompence) instead of moving his hat,
stretched both his arms out, and clasped his hands together
upon the crown of his hat, and held it close down to his
head; that all men might see, how odious that flattery was to
him, and that very approbation of the person, though at the
same time most popular.—<i>Clarendon.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Examine the paragraphs by Hawthorne
(<a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>), Macaulay, Webster, Huxley (<a href="#Page_107">pp.
107-8</a>) to see whether the sentences are units in substance.
Note also the different effects produced by
long and short sentences.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>III. A. Unity of Substance by Keeping to the
Point.</b>—In a hastily written manuscript will often
be found unlike ideas joined together in one sentence.
Some persons are worse than others in this
matter, but everybody, in composing rapidly, is
liable to the fault. It is amusingly easy to fly off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
at a tangent, if the parts of the paragraph have not
been properly thought out. The mind often works
erratically; it is pursuing a given idea when some
word used suggests a different line of thinking and
the train is switched off its track.</p>

<p>Cardinal Newman once wrote a burlesque of this
scatter-brained kind of writing. He pretends that
the lad is writing a theme on the topic, “Fortune favors
the brave.” In the midst of it the boy says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Napoleon, too, shows us how little we can rely on fortune;
but his faults, great as they were, are being redeemed
by his nephew, Louis Napoleon, who has shown himself
very different from what was expected, though he has never
explained how he came to swear to the constitution, and
then mounted the imperial throne.</p>

</div>

<p>Here the writer has not committed the comma
fault; he has not begun an independent sentence
after a comma. But he has set down ideas irrelevant
to the sentence, and, in this case, irrelevant
even to the theme.</p>

<p>This lack of unity often arises from putting
down, as the sentence proceeds, the details that
occur parenthetically to the writer; he empties his
mind upon the paper. Thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My aunt happened to notice, as she stood looking into
the glass and thinking how pretty she was, for she was
really pretty for one so old, that the eyes of a portrait or
one of the eyes was moving, for my aunt had a large picture
of my uncle in her room in her country-house, which was
in Derbyshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>B.</b> Many a sentence which ends in an irrelevant
clause can be made to show unity by the insertion of
some intermediate link that occurred in the mind
but was overlooked in the writing. “Johnson wrote
political articles, and took care that the Whigs did
not get the best of it,” becomes a unit if we supply
a few words: “Johnson wrote political articles, <i>and
in those which referred to parliamentary debates</i> took
care that the Whigs did not get the best of it.”
In other words, a sentence must not merely
include the <i>expressed</i> parts of a main thought,
as in the second kind of unity of substance; it
must <i>express</i> every part of the main thought.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON WELL-KNIT SENTENCES</span></h2>

<p>A sentence may be said to be well-knit if it
stands the following tests. It must have unity of
form; freedom from excessive looseness; a due
amount of emphasis; and climax, if climax is required.
All these technical terms need explanation.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Unity of Form.</b>—To be a unit of form, a sentence
must place subordinate thoughts in subordinate
clauses, and must keep one coherent
structure throughout.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Subordination of Clauses.</b>—In the early years
of a language, before it has been used to express
philosophy and science, the structure of the sentences
is loose and simple; it sounds like the
speech of a child. Here is a passage from a book
which appeared about 1370, as the <i>Voyage and
Travels of Sir John Mandeville</i>. There is some
doubt whether or not there was really a Sir John;
but these Travels are very interesting and curious
reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And some men say that in the Isle of Lango is yet the
daughter of Hippocrates, in form and likeness of a great
dragon, that is a hundred fathom of length, as men say:
for I have not seen her. And they of the Isles call her,
Lady of the Land. And she lieth in an old castle, in a
cave, and sheweth twice or thrice in the year. And she
doth no harm to no man, but if men do her harm. And
she was thus changed and transformed, from a fair damsel,
into likeness of a dragon, by a goddess, that was cleped
Diana. And men say, that she shall so endure in that
form of a dragon, unto the time that a knight come, that
is so hardy, that dare come to her and kiss her on the
mouth: and then shall she turn again to her own kind, and
be a woman again. But after that she shall not live long.</p>

</div>

<p>Though much of the naïve, childlike quality of
this passage is due to the archaic phraseology,
much also is due to the use of <i>and</i> and <i>but</i> instead
of other conjunctions.</p>

<p>In certain kinds of writing it is natural enough
that ideas should be strung together with <i>and</i>’s.
Thus: “It rained, and hailed, and blew, and snowed,
and froze, and they became weary of winter.” But
suppose that they did not weary of winter. The
sentence then would run, “Though it rained, and
hailed, and snowed, and froze, they did not become
weary of winter.” Here we have ceased the mere
enumeration of things that happened, one after
the other, and have stated a process of reasoning.
The result is a complex sentence. The ability to
construct good complex sentences means ability to
do careful thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>In every complex sentence there is some one
<i>proposition</i> that ought to stand out, with the
high light upon it. This is the thing we most
wish to say; to change the comparison, it is the
heart of the sentence. If the other parts can
be made subordinate to it, the strongest kind of
sentence unity is secured. In the sentence, “It
rained; it snowed; it hailed; they did not weary
of winter,” all the assertions are stated as equally
important. But, clearly enough, the last one is the
kernel of the sentence. Therefore the preceding
clauses ought to be reduced to their proper rank
by being made dependent.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Examine the following compound
sentences, to decide whether or not there is in each
some important thought to which the others ought
to have been subordinated. Then improve the
unity by reducing the subordinate ideas to dependent
clauses having a participle, or a relative adverb
like <i>when</i>.</p>

<p>1. Love is blind; it is not for want of eyes.</p>

<p>2. The soldiers were perhaps somewhat sleepy
with the sultriness of the afternoon; they had

<p>3. I spied an honest fellow coming along a lane,
and asked him if he had ever heard of a house
called the house of Shaws.</p>

<p>4. The next person I came across was a dapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
little man in a beautiful white wig; I knew well that
barbers were great gossips, and I asked him plainly
what kind of a man was Mr. Balfour of the Shaws.</p>

<p>5. In these days folk still believed in witches
and trembled at a curse; and this curse fell pat,
like a wayside omen, to arrest me; it took the pith
out of my legs.</p>

<p>6. I was called in at last; my uncle counted out
into my hand seven and thirty golden guinea pieces.</p>

<p>7. I had come close to one of the turns in the

<p class="tb"><b>The So Construction.</b>—The conjunction <i>so</i> is a
useful word, and the learner prefers it to its synonyms,
<i>therefore</i> and <i>consequently</i>, because it is
simpler, less formal than either. But in a narrative
which is liberally besprinkled with <i>so</i>’s the
reader feels that the simplicity is overdone. Here
is an extreme example.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A short time afterward my uncle died; so my aunt went

did not want to stay, but they did.</p>

<p>Examine the sentences just quoted, and show
the relations between the clauses by other devices
than the use of <i>so</i>.</p>

<p><i>So</i>, as a conjunction, should be employed very
sparingly. When it is employed, it should usually
be preceded by <i>a semicolon rather than a comma</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—A careful writer is known by
his use of conjunctions: he does not use <i>and</i> unless
the clauses joined are co-ordinate; nor <i>but</i> unless
there is a real opposition; nor a given subordinate
conjunction unless it is actually required by logic.
In the subjoined selections from Ruskin the original
conjunctions have been changed to those in italics.

<p>1. In employing all the muscular power at our disposal
we are to make the employments we choose as educational

is the first and best method of education, mental as
well as bodily. A man taught to plough, row, or steer well,
<i>moreover</i> a woman taught to cook properly, and make a
dress neatly, are already educated in many essential moral
habits. Labour considered as a discipline has hitherto been
thought of only for criminals, <i>therefore</i> the real and noblest
function of labour is to prevent crime, <i>but</i> not to be <i>Re</i>formatory,

<p>2. We must spend our money in some way, at some time,
<i>accordingly</i> it cannot at any time be spent without employing
somebody. <i>While</i> we gamble it away, the person who
wins it must spend it; <i>while</i> we lose it in a railroad speculation,
it has gone into some one else’s pockets, or merely
gone to pay navvies for making a useless embankment, <i>but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
not</i> to pay riband or button makers for making useless
ribands or buttons; we cannot lose it (unless by actually
destroying it) <i>and not give</i> employment of some kind;
<i>nevertheless</i> whatever quantity of money exists, the relative
quantity of employment must some day come out of it;
<i>and</i> the distress of the nation signifies that the employments
given have produced nothing that will support its existence.
Men cannot live on ribands, or buttons, or velvet,
or by going quickly from place to place; <i>but</i> every coin
spent in useless ornament, or useless motion, is so much
withdrawn from the national means of life.—<span class="smcap">Ruskin.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="tb"><b>One Coherent Structure.</b>—We have seen that to
be well-knit a sentence must have that unity of
form which gives every thought its proper clause-rank.
It must also be uniform in structure. There
should be no sudden, unnecessary change in subject,
or in the form of the verb. Sometimes a sentence
is pulled about by the mind as a child by a
cross nurse. It begins in the active voice, it is
twitched aside into the passive. It begins as the
act of one person, it ends as that of another. Even
so admirable a writer as John Fiske has this sentence:
“But Howe could not bear to acknowledge
the defeat of his attempts to storm, and accordingly,
at five o’clock, with genuine British persistency,
a third attack was ordered.” This “British
persistency” is evidently Howe’s. Why not give
him full credit for it, thus?—“But Howe could
not bear to acknowledge the defeat of his attempts
to storm, and accordingly, at five o’clock, with genuine
British persistency he ordered a third attack.”</p>

by him that such an invitation must not
be refused.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Loose Sentence.</b>—The passage given at the
beginning of the chapter, from Mandeville, is written
in what are called loose sentences. <i>Loose</i> as
applied to a sentence, does not necessarily mean
that the sentence is bad,—that it is rambling or
disjointed. A loose sentence is one in which
an independent statement comes first, followed by
others, dependent or independent. Example:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
“And some men say that in the Isle of Lango is
yet the daughter of Hippocrates, in form and likeness
of a great dragon, that is a hundred fathom of
length, as men say: for I have not seen her.” In
this sentence comes first a proposition,—“And
some men say,” followed by several subordinate
clauses, and by one independent clause,—“for I
have not seen her.” The test of a loose sentence
is a grammatical one: the sentence can be closed at
some point before the end, without hurting the
grammatical structure. At what places in the
sentence just quoted is the grammatical structure
complete?</p>

<p>The loose sentence is used freely in conversation.
The speaker gives his main idea first, and qualifies
it afterward. Therefore the legitimate effect of
the loose sentence is to lend an air of simplicity,
a colloquial air, to the style. The danger is that
it may become a mere sequence of clauses, that
dangle insecurely, each from the preceding, like
needles hanging from a magnet. Avoid long loose
sentences.</p>

<p>Examine the sentence by Defoe, <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>. It is a
fine example of what a loose sentence should not be.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Periodic Sentence.</b>—In the sentence, “A
short time afterward my uncle died; so my aunt
went to her country-house in Derbyshire,” the
grammatical structure is complete at “died.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
if the two clauses be welded together by <i>because</i>,
they will no longer be grammatically free. Thus:
“<i>Because my uncle died shortly afterward, my aunt
went to her country-house in Derbyshire.</i>” This
sentence is periodic in form. A periodic sentence
is a complex sentence in which the modifiers of
the verb precede the verb. The effect of this
structure is to delay the main idea of the sentence
until the last.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Obviously, if too many
subordinate ideas occur before the main one, the
mind of the reader will weary with the tension
of expectation. Short periodic sentences however
are extremely effective in arousing the reader’s
attention and holding it till the important idea
is stated. It is plain that good periodic structure
is highly conducive to unity in the sentence: each
subordinate idea is held in its proper place of subordination
till the main idea is stated, and on the
reader is flashed a pleasant sense that the structure
has grown naturally into one complete whole.</p>

whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any
virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.—<i>Philippians.</i></p>

<p>4. “Sir, you may destroy this little institution; it is
weak; it is in your hands! I know it is one of the lesser
lights in the literary horizon of our country. You may put
it out. But, if you do so, you must carry through your
work! You must extinguish, one after another, all those
greater lights of science which, for more than a century,
have thrown their radiance over our land! It is, Sir, as I
have said, a small college. And yet there are those who
love it.”—<span class="smcap">Webster.</span></p>

<p>5. Sir, let me recur to pleasing recollections; let me
indulge in refreshing remembrance of the past; let me remind
you that, in early times, no States cherished greater
harmony, both of principle and feeling, than Massachusetts
and South Carolina. Would to God that harmony might
again return! Shoulder to shoulder they went through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Revolution; hand in hand they stood round the administration
of Washington, and felt his own great arm lean on
them for support. Unkind feeling, if it exist, alienation
and distrust, are the growth, unnatural to such soils, of
false principles since sown. They are weeds, the seeds of
which that same great arm never scattered.—<span class="smcap">Webster.</span></p>

<p>6. That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who
has been so trained in youth that his body is the ready
servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all the
work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect
is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of equal
strength, and in smooth working order; ready, like a
steam engine, to be turned to any kind of work, and spin
the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind;
whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the great and
fundamental truths of Nature and of the laws of her operations;
one who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire,
but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous
will, the servant of a tender conscience; who has learned to
love all beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to hate all vileness,
and to respect others as himself.—<span class="smcap">Huxley.</span></p>

<p>7. If then the power of speech is a gift as great as any
that can be named,—if the origin of language is by many
philosophers even considered to be nothing short of divine,—if
by means of words the secrets of the heart are brought
to light, pain of soul is relieved, hidden grief is carried off,
sympathy conveyed, counsel imparted, experience recorded,
and wisdom perpetuated,—if by great authors the many
are drawn up into unity, national character is fixed, a
people speaks, the past and the future, the East and the
West are brought into communication with each other,—if
such men are, in a word, the spokesmen and prophets of
the human family,—it will not answer to make light of
Literature or to neglect its study; rather we may be sure
that, in proportion as we master it in whatever language,
and imbibe its spirit, we shall ourselves become in our own
measure the ministers of like benefits to others, be they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Each of the passages given above
should be read aloud as a whole, to get the effects
produced by the different types of sentence. In
the first passage note that the first clause arouses
interest by the periodic structure. So do the
first and third sentences in the second passage;
but the third and fourth—loose—have a fine simplicity
that adds to the weight of their subject
matter. The third passage moves up steadily to
an impressive point,—the word <i>think</i>. The fourth
passage is extremely direct and earnest. Webster
is pleading for his <i>Alma Mater</i>, Dartmouth; is
making an appeal, straight from his heart. Almost
choked with emotion, he has no desire to frame
periodic sentences and nicely subordinated clauses.
In the fifth passage he is perhaps equally direct;
but he is master of himself, and his sentences are
somewhat more elaborate. In the sixth passage,
Huxley gets a steadily increasing strength of
thought, but not of structure. Cardinal Newman,
on the other hand, builds up his period with superb
suspense both of form and thought.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Change the sentence by Huxley
into the periodic form. This can be done by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
changing the order of clauses, and beginning each
subordinate clause with <i>if</i>, or with <i>suppose</i>, or with
a relative.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Emphasis in the Sentence.</b>—A sentence cannot
be called well-knit if it does not succeed in calling
most attention to the most important idea. We
have seen already how important it is to put the
unimportant parts of the sentence into subordinate
clauses. How may further emphasis be
had?</p>

<p>The beginning and the end of the sentence are
the most prominent places. Important words
should usually stand in these places. Rarely
should these points be covered up with trivial
expressions. Compare two sentences. “As a matter
of fact, it is bread, rather than advice, that
people actually need, in this city.” “Bread it is,
rather than advice, that, in this city, people actually
need.”</p>

<p>Attention can always be called to a word by
placing it out of the ordinary, commonplace order.
The <i>inverted</i> order, where verb precedes the noun,
or predicate adjective precedes the verb, frequently
permits emphasis to be put just where it is wanted.
The oft-quoted example is as good a one as can
be found: “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!”
How much better it is, how much <i>greater</i> the cry
is than, “Diana of the Ephesians is great!”</p>

<p>“For all books are divisible into two classes,—the

<p class="tb"><b>Climax.</b>—The principle of climax demands that
in a series of related terms the weaker degree
should precede the stronger. Southey says of Lord
Nelson’s being permitted to live to hear the news
of his great victory: “That consolation, that joy,
that triumph, was afforded him.” By these three
nouns the reader ascends, as if by a ladder—climax
is merely Greek for ladder. Endeavor to discover
the original order in which the following sentences
were written to secure climax. Changing them by
slight omissions, weave them together into two
sentences.</p>

<p>“The most triumphant death is that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
martyr. The most splendid death is that of the
hero in the hour of victory. If the chariot and
the horses of fire had been vouchsafed for Nelson’s
translation, he could scarcely have departed
in a brighter blaze of glory. The most
awful death is that of the martyred patriot.
He has left us, not indeed his mantle of inspiration,
but an example which will continue to be our
shield and our strength, and a name which is our
pride—an example and a name which are at this
hour inspiring hundreds of the youth of England.”</p>

<span class="smaller">ON ORGANIZING THE THEME</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Different Ways of Planning.</b>—There are various
kinds of composition,—description, narration, argument,
and others. These will be treated one by
one in later chapters. Each kind has laws of its
own. Each has its own vocabulary, which may
well be studied apart from other vocabularies. So,
too, each type calls for special methods of organization.
For the present, only a few principles of
planning, applicable to all types alike, need be considered.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Growth of a Thought.</b>—When a thought is
first conceived, it is always misty, dim, nebulous.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
When we speak of having a “general notion,” a
“vague notion,” we usually mean that a thought is
just beginning. If it receives attention, it emerges
from the nebulous condition and forms into several
definite thoughts. Or, to change the figure, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
grows and branches. Suppose that the mind
awakes to the vague notion that the room is getting
cold. <i>Cold</i> is the undeveloped root from which
may presently branch off such thoughts as these:
“Yes, it is really cold. In fact, I feel cold all over.
My hands are blue, and I am shivering. Besides,
Horace over there is standing with his back to the
radiator, and so he too must be cold.” The thought
has grown into several sentences. <i>Cold</i> branched
into <i>I am cold all over</i>, and this also sent off two
shoots—<i>My hands are blue, and I am shivering.</i>
Then the mind stopped this line of branching, and
out from the stock sprang a new branch: <i>Horace is
standing with his back to the radiator</i>; and then this
sends off the branch <i>and so he too must be cold</i>.
Try to draw a picture to represent the process that
has gone on.</p>

<p>Now, the whole growth of a thought—stock and
branches—can sometimes be expressed within
the limits of one grammatical sentence. If there
are too many thoughts for this, they are put into
separate sentences, and the whole is called a miniature
composition, or isolated paragraph.</p>

<p>Exactly as a paragraph grows, so a long composition
may grow out of one vague idea. Some ideas
have in them only enough matter to be developed
into a paragraph. Others are germs from which
whole books might grow. “That apple looks good”
would probably develop into a short paragraph;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but, “it is strange that that apple should fall to the
earth instead of away from it” might blossom into
a great system of natural philosophy. If a nebulous
idea has in it the making of a long theme, it
will develop into main parts if the attention be
fixed keenly upon it. These are paragraph nebulæ,
which will subdivide into sentences. Or, to vary
the figure, the main thought will send out main
branches (paragraphs) which will send off lesser
ones (sentences).</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Unity.</b>—Although thought grows, one must keep
in mind that it does not always grow to fruit unless
it is trained and pruned. Thought loves to branch,
and unless restrained by a stern sense of logic, it
will often end in a mere tangle of superfluous twigs
and leaves. To speak less figuratively, every writer
is in danger of setting down matters suggested by
the subject in hand but not logically related to it.
This is as true of a large piece of work as of a
sentence (compare <a href="#Page_90">page 90</a>). Every theme, like
every sentence, should have unity. It should be
the development of one idea—a large, complex
idea, if you please, but, nevertheless, one. No
matter how long or how short the whole, it must
all concern the different phases of one thing
or one thought. It should grow naturally from
one germ. Every part in it should bear on the
central idea of the whole—so that, after reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
any given sentence, the reader can see a real connection
between title and sentence. A well-organized
composition cannot spare any part; each is
essential to its life. Milton said, “Almost as well
kill a man as kill a good book”; and we may
adapt this idea to the structure of the theme. A
good composition is so well organized that if you
cut it anywhere it will bleed.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Planning a Paragraph.</b>—Before writing a paragraph,
try to think out the whole of it. Let the
thought grow in the mind before you let it grow
on paper. This method will afford a chance to review
the whole mentally and to determine whether
the thoughts follow each other logically.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Topic Sentence.</b>—When an after-dinner
speaker rises to respond to a toast, he generally
announces his topic at once, or after a sentence or
two of introduction. He is very likely also to announce
at once his chief thought about the subject;
for he knows that people like to hear him come to
the point. If however he has reason to think
that his hearers may not agree with him immediately,
he is likely to state his subject first, and
then lead up gradually to his own conclusion
about it.</p>

<p>We naturally follow some such course in writing.
With each paragraph we begin a new speech, as it
were. It is a matter both of courtesy and of economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
if in each we state definitely what we are
talking about. The topic sentence of a paragraph
ordinarily states the general <i>subject</i>, or else declares
the general <i>thought</i>, i.e. <i>conclusion</i>, of the
whole. It is generally short, because emphatic.</p>

<p>The following paragraph shows its general <i>subject</i>
in the opening sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A Tree-Planting Association has been organized in New
York City. The Association will be organized with twelve
or more members on a block, who will form a local club
under the Association. A tree-planting association may, in
this city, fail to plant trees, but it certainly will encourage
the planting of window boxes, the fencing of unused lots,
the painting of fences to the exclusion of posters, and the
general care of the public street. Back yards will assume
some relation to the general good of the community, and
trees, vines, and flowers will find place in them. The children
will be taught to care for the appearance of the block,
and chalk-marks and other defacements will soon disappear,
because of new-born civic pride.—<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

<p>In the following paragraph, Macaulay does not
state his topic till the second sentence. The first
is a general remark by way of introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One of the first objects of an inquirer, who wishes to
form a correct notion of the state of a community at a given
time, must be to ascertain of how many persons that community
then consisted. <i>Unfortunately the population of
England in 1685, cannot be ascertained with perfect accuracy.</i>
For no great state had then adopted the wise course
of periodically numbering the people. All men were left
to conjecture for themselves; and, as they generally conjectured
without examining facts, and under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of strong passions and prejudices, their guesses were often
ludicrously absurd. Even intelligent Londoners ordinarily
talked of London as containing several millions of souls.
It was confidently asserted by many that, during the thirty-five
years which had elapsed between the accession of Charles
the First and the Restoration, the population of the City had
increased by two millions. Even while the ravages of the
plague and fire were recent, it was the fashion to say that
the capital still had a million and a half of inhabitants.
Some persons, disgusted by these exaggerations, ran violently
into the opposite extreme. Thus Isaac Vossius, a
man of undoubted parts and learning, strenuously maintained
that there were only two millions of human beings
in England, Scotland, and Ireland taken together.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>:

<p>In the following paragraph, the topic sentence
states the general <i>thought</i> of the whole.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I cite as an instance of <i>the absence of vandalism in
Japan</i> the experience of a Japanese friend of mine who
lived on a street near and parallel to the busiest street in
Tokio. He had placed in his front gate, bordering immediately
upon the sidewalk, an exquisite panel carved in
delicate tracery and nearly two hundred years old. Such
a specimen would be placed in our Museums of Art under
lock and key. On my expressing surprise that he would
expose so precious a relic without fear that some heedless
boy might break off a twig, or otherwise deface it, he
assured me it was quite as safe there as in his library.
Three years afterwards I chanced to be in Japan again, and
though my friend was dead, and a stranger occupied the
premises, I was led to seek the place to ascertain the condition
of the delicate wood-carving. It was absolutely uninjured,
though slightly bleached by the weather, and this
in the great commercial city of Tokio, with a population of
over one million.—<span class="smcap">Edward S. Morse.</span><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Kinds of Paragraphs.</b>—What can be said within
the limits of a paragraph? The same things that
can be said in a sentence, but more fully. We need
to consider here only a few of these. The sentences
may repeat the substance of the topic sentence,
adding something new. Or, if the paragraph states
the general conclusion first, the succeeding sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
may give the needed particulars, or illustrations,
or examples, or proofs. Once more, the
paragraph may open with the statement of a
<i>cause</i>, this being followed by the statement of a
necessary <i>effect</i>. Or, the paragraph as a whole
may develop a <i>contrast</i>. Or, it may consist of a
group of sentences that narrate the particulars of
some event, or describe some scene.</p>

<p>The following paragraph exhibits a single thought
by repetition.</p>

that were resonant beneath the snap of your finger. There
were opulent pears, distilling the golden sun into their
bottles. There were plums, the kind that succeed. Grapes
there were, and quinces, and peaches,—the last not so
prolific as the apples, but a very worthy fruit.</p>

in all their facts a language by which to illustrate and

speaker how much he has already lived, through the poverty
or the splendor of his speech. Life lies behind us as the quarry

paragraphs from Irving’s <i>Sketch-Book</i>, endeavoring
to discover what office each sentence performs in
the paragraph.</p>

<p>“We had not been long home when the sound
of music was heard from a distance. A band of
country lads, without coats, their shirt-sleeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fancifully tied with ribbons, their hats decorated
with greens, and clubs in their hands, were seen
advancing up the avenue, followed by a large
number of villagers and peasantry. They stopped
before the hall door, where the music struck up
a peculiar air, and the lads performed a curious
and intricate dance, advancing, retreating, and
striking their clubs together, keeping exact time
to the music; while one, whimsically crowned with
a fox’s skin, the tail of which flaunted down his
back, kept capering round the skirts of the dance,
and rattling a Christmas-box with many antic
gesticulations.”</p>

<p>“After the dance was concluded, the whole party
was entertained with brawn and beef and stout
home-brewed. The ’Squire himself mingled among
the rustics, and was received with awkward demonstrations
of deference and regard. It is true,
I perceived two or three of the younger peasants,
as they were raising their tankards to their
mouths, when the ’Squire’s back was turned, making
something of a grimace, and giving each other
the wink; but the moment they caught my eye
they pulled grave faces, and were exceedingly demure.
With Master Simon, however, they all
seemed more at their ease. His varied occupations
and amusements had made him well known
throughout the neighborhood. He was a visitor
at every farm-house and cottage; gossiped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

<p class="tb"><b>Expansion of One Paragraph into Several.</b>—Let
it be supposed that having composed a theme of
one paragraph, a student has been asked to develop
the subject at greater length; the paragraph has 85
words, and the audience wants 200, or 225. What
will be the right course? It is possible to expand
one paragraph of 85 words into one paragraph of
225 words. But if the paragraph of 85 words has
two or three distinct parts, it is better to expand
each into a new paragraph.</p>

<p>Let it be imagined that Dr. Wood, the English
naturalist, had written a very short paragraph on
the Crustacea; that it ran somewhat like this.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crustacea</span></p>

<p>The aquatic animals known as the Crustacea have no
internal skeleton, but are defended by a strong crust, made
of a series of rings. This unyielding armor, together with
the coverings of the eyes, the tendons of the claws, and the
lining membrane of the stomach, with its teeth, is cast off
annually to permit the growth of the body. The Crustacea
possess the power of reproducing a lost or original limb;
and, indeed, if injured the animal itself shakes off the injured
joint.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose, now, that Dr. Wood found himself dissatisfied
with these somewhat cramped and overloaded
sentences, and determined to rewrite, making
three paragraphs where he had formerly but one.
In the new theme, the main topics would be, as
before: <i>Definition of Crustacea</i>; <i>Annual shedding</i>;
<i>Reproduction of Limbs</i>. Each would have a paragraph
to itself, where before it had but a sentence.
All the sentences to be made about the Definition
would be set off by themselves as one main part
of the theme; all those about the Shedding would
form a second; all those about the New Limbs, a
third.</p>

<p>“Set off”;—that is, by <i>indentation</i>, or <i>indention</i>.
This word means, “a biting in,” or, more properly,
“a biting out.” Where a new division of the theme
begins, the first line does not come up plumb to
the straight edge at the left; it is bitten into; it
begins farther to the right than do the other lines.
In the printed book, the indentation is small—usually
the width of a letter <i>m</i>. But in a manuscript
it is important for the indentation to be absolutely
unmistakable. Some persons keep so ragged an
edge at the left hand that it is impossible to know
whether or not they should be credited with understanding
what a paragraph is. Indent each new
paragraph one or two inches. Bring every line of
the paragraph, <i>except the last</i>, up even with the
right-hand margin; the last line may be stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
anywhere, if the paragraph is complete in sense;
often this line has but a word or two. If at any
time you inadvertently omit the indentation, and
have not time to copy, place a paragraph mark
where the new paragraph should begin; thus, ¶.</p>

<p>A rough outline for Dr. Wood’s new paragraphs
could now be made. The topics being known, the
number of sentences under each could be guessed
at. There is nothing in the original paragraph to
show that Dr. Wood ascribed especial importance
to some one of the three topics. The third is
perhaps the least important. It may be estimated
that in the completed theme he would give about
80 words to each of the first two, and about 50 to the
third. The outline would be something like this,
the full stops representing those of the future
theme.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crustacea</span></p>

<p>¶ Crustacea are aquatic. No skeleton, but crust, which
protects and strengthens. Framework of rings; part develops
into limbs. Articulated animals.</p>

<p>¶ Curious way of growth. Other animals not inconvenienced
as they grow. Not so Crustacea. Mail unyielding.
Is cast off annually and larger coat grows. Eye-covering,
tendons, stomach-membrane are also shed.</p>

<p>¶ Curious reproduction of lost or injured limb. New one
grows if old lost; animal shakes off injured joint. Lobsters
do, when alarmed.</p>

</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Dr. Wood did write a short
chapter on the Crustacea, and here it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crustacea</span></p>

<p>The Crustacea are almost all aquatic animals. They have
no internal skeleton, but their body is covered with a strong
crust, which serves for protection as well as for strength.
Their whole framework consists of a series of rings fitted to,
and working in each other; some forming limbs, and others
developing into the framework supporting the different
organs. From this reason, they and the remaining animals,
as far as the star-fishes, who have no limbs at all, are called
“articulated” animals.</p>

<p>Their method of growth is very curious. Other animals,
as they increase in size, experience no particular inconvenience.
Not so the Crustacea. Their bodies are closely enveloped
in a strong, unyielding mail, which cannot grow
with them. Their armor is therefore cast off every year,
and a fresh coat formed to suit their increased dimensions.
Not only is the armor cast off, but even the covering of the
eyes, the tendons of the claws, and the lining membrane of
the stomach, with its teeth.</p>

<p>They all also possess the curious power of reproducing a
lost or injured limb. In the former case, a fresh limb supplies
the place of that lost; and in the latter case, the animal
itself shakes off the injured joint, and a new one soon
takes its place. Lobsters, when alarmed, frequently throw
off their claws.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Choose one of the following paragraphs
and expand it into a theme. Each
sentence should grow into a paragraph. The
proportions to be observed are suggested by the
number of amplifying sentences prescribed for
the different paragraphs. Write a title above the

unwise, because it threatens the extinction of certain

those who do not. [This introductory sentence
may be made a part of the first paragraph.] The
people who know what they want are few. [Three

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Discuss with the instructor and
the class the best way of paragraphing each of
the following topics. Form first an idea as to
how many paragraphs each should have and what
should be the paragraph subjects. 1. This recitation
room. 2. How Lincoln looked. 3. A painting
I like. 4. What I do in a day. 5. My plans.
6. The walk to school. 7. My past education.
8. The elm. 9. The construction of the steam
engine. 10. An ocean steamer. 11. Evening in
the country.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Read carefully the following
speech and state the paragraph subjects. Estimate
the number of words in each paragraph, and say
whether you think the proportion of parts is bad
or good. The speech will be recognized as that
delivered by Lincoln at the dedication of the
Gettysburg National Cemetery. It was written
first as one paragraph; but a year later, in making
a copy, the President divided it as you see.</p>

<p>“Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.</p>

<p>“Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
on a great battlefield of that war. We have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place
for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.</p>

<p>“But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we
cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow this
ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our
poor power to add or detract. The world will
little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here. It is
for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to
the unfinished work which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for
us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us—that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of devotion,—that we
here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain,—that this nation, under God, shall
have a new birth of freedom,—and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—The importance of modelling
all work on the right scale is illustrated in the
task of the editor of an encyclopædia. His problem
is to give each subject space and prominence
according to its importance. Opening Johnson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Encyclopædia, I find seven columns devoted to
Shakespeare. Of these, two and a half are given to
the poet’s life, four and a half to his works. Is the
proportion about right? If you were editing an
encyclopædia of geography, how much space should
you give to Africa as compared with Europe? How
much, if the encyclopædia dealt with civilization?</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise in Proportioning.</b>—In treating each
of the following subjects, (<i>a</i>) what paragraph topics
might be chosen? (<i>b</i>) which paragraph ought to
be the longest, dealing with the most important
phase of the subject? 1. Living statesmen. 2. Advantages
of country life. 3. The life of Lincoln.
4. The uses of gold. 5. A railway accident. 6. A
cyclone. 7. A visit to an art-gallery. 8. A week
of camping.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Exercise in Varying the Scale.</b>—Read one of the
following poems. Then write two papers, the first
retelling (not closely paraphrasing) the story of the
poem in one paragraph of about 100 words, the
second retelling the same story in a theme of 300
words, properly paragraphed. <i>In each theme give
space to every part according to its relative importance.</i></p>

<p>Browning: Tray—about vivisection; Clive—story
of courage; Incident of the French camp—story
of heroism; How we brought the good news
from Ghent to Aix—story of endurance; The Pied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Piper of Hamelin—story of pathos; Muleykeh—owner’s
pride in a horse; The Bean Feast—a
Pope’s humility. Longfellow: The Fell of Atri;
Paul Revere’s Ride; Evangeline; The Legend
Beautiful; Robert of Sicily. Lowell: The Vision
of Sir Launfal. Drayton: The Ballad of Agincourt
(<i>Heart of Oak Books</i>, Vol. V.). Thackeray: Chronicle
of the Drum (<i>Ibid.</i>). Tennyson: The Revenge
(<i>Ibid.</i>). Coleridge: The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner (<i>Ibid.</i>). Whittier: Skipper Ireson’s Ride
(<i>Ibid.</i>).</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Choice of Topic; Method of Work.</b>—It is easier
to choose among definite theme subjects, printed in
the book, than to choose from an unlimited number
of topics. Left free, a person may be attracted to
a subject that is either too large, or else mechanically
limited. The latter kind is the easier to
manage. “The parts of a certain city,” is a topic
easily paragraphed. To choose no subjects but
such as this would lead a person into making his
theme in water-tight compartments. On the other
hand, what can any one write in half an hour that
will interest a reasonable being in such a subject
as Water, or Clouds, or Steam, or Electricity, or
the Rise and Fall of Nations?</p>

<p>If the student is given free choice of a subject,
he should select something that he really cares
about, and that he wishes some definite audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to care about. Different modes of treatment are
necessary to interest different audiences.</p>

<p>Very often the attractive subject will not be
capable of easy analysis. In such a case, choose
only a few paragraph topics, thus narrowing the
treatment; pick out the most attractive phases of
the subject.</p>

<p><i>This done, invent a theme title that will give an
adequate hint of what is coming.</i> The actor, Mr.
Joseph Jefferson, once made a charming talk to
some college men about the “starring system,”
concluding with remarks about the fancy of some
people that Bacon wrote Shakespeare and put a
cryptogram into the plays. A college periodical,
wanting to give some hint of both topics, reported
the speech under the heading “Stars and Cryptograms.”
It was not a very good title, for it was
meaningless. But it was designed to rouse curiosity,
and, taken in connection with Jefferson’s
name, it did as well, I dare say, as a less vague
and fanciful title.</p>

<p>Let it be supposed that a person is to choose
a subject for a simple theme,—any subject he
pleases. He is to select one that will interest high
school students as well as himself. His window
looks out on a lake. How will <i>Lakes</i> do, for a
topic? It is too large; one would never have done.
Nobody enjoys reading a small theme on a large
matter. The window affords a glimpse of the lake;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
perhaps this <i>Glimpse of the Lake</i> would serve for
a theme. There would be no difficulty in paragraphing;
one section would go to the water, one
to the boats, one to the sky. But the water would
have to be described exactly as it now looks, though
looking its worst. The boats are all absent except
one, and perhaps there are other kinds that
he would like to tell about. Besides, the lad in
the boat is fishing, and the writer may be glad to
tell about the fishing on this lake. If however
memories of the past few days must be dragged in
to make the theme interesting to us all, why, the
name must be changed. The writer may call it,
<i>A Glimpse of the Lake and Some Memories</i>; the
title can then be interpreted with some elasticity.</p>

<p>What, now, are the chief things to say? A brief
paragraph of introduction, perhaps, though that is
by no means necessary. Then something about the
look of the lake. Then a word about the boats.
Then something about the fishing. Here is enough:
<i>water</i>, <i>boats</i>, <i>fishing</i>.</p>

<p>Now for the outline. ¶ Sprained ankle, armchair.
Must study landscape. Window shows
lake. ¶ Lake has moods. Dull now. Glare this
morning, colors last night. Sometimes calm; crystal
depths. Ripples. Wind makes it blossom;
raises undercurrents. Rain quiets it. Freckled
look. Queer way water <i>fits</i> land. ¶ Steamer seen.
Variety of boats. Red-stack boats. Swarms of passengers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Boats gay at night. Launches. Pulse of
engines. Sailboat. It upset, the other day. Rowboats.
Fisherman. ¶ Casting for bass. Amateur.
Wish him luck! I tried for pike. Tried for bass.
No luck. Tried for perch. Caught a bass. [Six
or eight sentences.]</p>

<p>In the last paragraph it perhaps occurs to the
writer that the bullheads bite when the water is
muddy; and this <i>muddiness</i> suggests the first paragraph;
the <i>muddiness</i> should be described back
there with the changing look of the water.</p>

<p>Next, the composition. It is not offered as a
model of style, but to suggest a possible way of
organizing any simple theme.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Glimpse of the Lake, and Some Memories</span></p>

<p>Here I am, planted in an armchair before the window,
my sprained ankle reposing, or trying to repose, on a smaller
chair. In such a position one must be thankful for his
mercies; he must take the exceptional chance to study the
landscape. Fortunately, the window cuts off a goodly section
of the lake which lies down there below.</p>

<p>An exquisite thing is the lake, with as many moods as a
baby. Just now it is dull in color, for the sky is overcast
and there is mist in the air. But early this morning it
blazed with light, and last night at sunset it was awake
with every fashion of color. Sometimes, when the heavens
are bare and windless, the water takes on an indescribable
calm; and then if you look down from this height there
seems to be no surface at all—only depths of blue, such as
the poets are always likening to crystal or to sapphire. At
other times clouds and a breeze move over it, and the surface
ruffles till one’s mind is tired with fancying the million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
lines of ripples. If the wind stiffens and stays by, there
soon are waves; the water breaks white and springs up in
blossoms over the whole dark field; then the under streams
are roused out of their quiet and the whole mass thunders
in upon the shore, muddy but grand. Now it begins to
rain; and rain is the witch that charms the savage waters
into rest. Presently the surface is dull again, but for the
freckled look made by the plunging drops. One notes
through the gathering mist an odd thing—the way the
water seems to settle into place, fitting into the curves and
nooks of the shore; the edge of the lake seems to grow
white and distinct, and to cling to the land in a sharp
outline.</p>

<p>Breaking through that white streak of water near the
shore comes a dark something, which soon takes form and
is seen to be a steamer. What a variety of craft haunt the
lake! The largest are these tall steamers, taller still for
their red stacks. At night, with their colored lights, they
look like jewelled slippers. By day they carry crowds,
which seem to rim each deck with a black band. Then
there are the launches, slipping here and there straight
across the bow of the bigger craft. They have a curiously
trim and self-satisfied look; and their naphtha engines, beating
no louder than some great, fast pulse, seem to make fun
of the slow-puffing monsters that stain the air with smoke.
A sailboat—a little sloop—slips across the picture. It is
the one that upset the other day and gave my friend the
Doctor a thorough soaking. Two rowboats are standing to
the south. In the bow of one there’s a lone fisherman.</p>

<p>That lad is casting for bass. He is an amateur—from
his dress. Better luck to him than has thus far befallen the
amateur who sits watching him from this window! I trolled
in the lake for silver pike, but with never a rise to break the
monotony. Then I tried thrice in the early morning for
yellow bass, using first minnows for bait, afterward grasshoppers,
and lastly frogs. No luck! Disgusted, I stole out
one afternoon to catch perch, hoping to be seen by no one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The perch bit languidly, and the few that were taken seemed
to have a supercilious look. “Here’s my last worm!” I
cried; “then for the hotel and farewell to these fishing
grounds where no fish are.” A bite! a competent, masterly,
vicious bite! It’s a bass, strayed away from home, and too
hungry to ask for delicate diet! Pull him in—seize the line,
for the pole is light and the hook is small. Safely landed,
and not less in weight than two pounds! Let them brag of
six-pounders; this gleaming, muscular fellow, smelling of
fresh water and mint, is good enough game for me. As I
gaze and remember, the amateur in his boat moves out of
the picture frame and the lake is a blank again.</p>

who, though considerably your junior, distinctly
commands your respect, and explain to him high
school ways of studying either (<i>a</i>) physiography,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
or (<i>b</i>) history, or (<i>c</i>) Latin, or (<i>d</i>) manual training,
or (<i>e</i>) English, or some other subject. The theme
should consist of one paragraph, of about 200 words.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral and Written Exercise.</b>—Choose <i>three</i> of
the following subjects, and think what illustrations
you would use to make them clear to different
audiences. Draw upon your knowledge of the
things that are most familiar to the experience of
each audience. Jot down memoranda of the illustrations
that you suggest, and afterward compare
notes in the oral discussion. For example,</p>

<p>Explain, by illustration:—</p>

<ul>
<li><i>A gentleman</i>, to a gamin.</li>
<li><i>Ice</i>, to a native of the tropics.</li>
<li><i>The charm of foot-ball</i>, to a girl.</li>
<li><i>The pleasure of work</i>, to a shirk.</li>
<li><i>Wagner’s music</i>, to a deaf painter.</li>
<li><i>The charm of foot-ball</i>, to a soldier.</li>
<li><i>The solar system</i>, to a child of eight.</li>
<li><i>Oranges</i>, to a native of the polar regions.</li>
<li><i>The charm of a true lady</i>, to an awkward lad.</li>
<li><i>The Jungle Book</i>, to a North American Indian.</li>
<li><i>A newsboy’s life</i>, to an earl’s son or a millionnaire’s
son.</li>
<li><i>A sleepless night</i>, to a person who sleeps like a
top.</li>
<li><i>A headache</i>, to a person who never had a headache.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></li>
<li><i>The charm of Stevenson</i>, to a reader of dime
novels.</li>
<li><i>Taking gas at the dentist’s</i>, to a person who never
lost a tooth.</li>
<li><i>An encyclopædia</i>, to a man who never heard of
such a book.</li>
<li><i>Paragraph construction</i>, to a youth who cares
only for the shop.</li>
<li><i>The danger of open windows</i>, to a child who
never heard of death.</li>
<li><i>Some good monthly</i>, to a bright boy or girl who
had never seen a magazine.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tb"><b>Transitions between Paragraphs.</b>—Suppose that
a given theme is a unit, no idea being admitted
that does not bear on the topic; suppose, further,
that the paragraphs are units, each treating a distinct
part of the theme idea; it remains to be sure
that the reader gets easily from paragraph to paragraph.
Sometimes the writer is so anxious to
make each paragraph a unit in itself that the
reader does not feel at once that the new section
has anything to do with the preceding.</p>

<p>Look back to the theme on the <i>Glimpse of the
Lake</i>. There were three things to talk about:
water, boats, fishing. At the end of the paragraph
on <i>the water</i> the attention must be led over without
any jar to the subject of <i>boats</i>. The last idea of
the <i>water</i> paragraph was that the edge of the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
grew white and distinct. In beginning the new
paragraph, we may refer to that idea. “Breaking
through that white streak of water near the
shore comes a dark something,” etc.</p>

<p>Now look at the paragraph on fishing. How
does the writer try to get over to the <i>fishing</i> from
the <i>boats</i>? Explain in recitation.</p>

<p>The joints of the theme should be smooth and
strong, like the joints of bamboo—not a rude joint
made by chisel and hammer.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—The instructor will hand you
in class your themes thus far written. Go over
them carefully, trying by revision to make the
thought connection closer between the paragraphs.
For the future, always read carefully the whole
paragraph before beginning the next.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Transitions between Sentences.</b>—Within the
paragraph each sentence should grow vitally out
of the preceding. “Connection is the soul of
good writing,” said the great translator, Jowett
of Balliol. <i>Plan sentences ahead; and read each
sentence before you write the next.</i> Make it impossible
for people to say of you as they used to say
of Emerson, “His sentences read equally well in
any order.” Make it impossible to pick a sentence
out and set it down elsewhere, without tearing the
theme as Æneas rent young Polydore.</p>

<p>Frequently the sentences can be bound tighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
together by beginning the next with a reference
to some idea contained in the preceding. Burke,
pleading in Parliament for America, said: “But
with regard to her own internal establishment, she
may, I doubt not she will, contribute in moderation.
I say in moderation, for she ought not to be
permitted to exhaust herself. She ought to be reserved
to a war, the weight of which, with the
enemies that we are most likely to have, must be
considerable in her quarter of the globe. There
she may serve you, and serve you essentially.”
Here the last words of each sentence suggest the
first words of the next. Of course this way of
getting coherence is easily overdone; but it is very
valuable, nevertheless.</p>

<p>It is easy to discover the order in which Ruskin
wrote the following sentences, here printed in
wrong order. Find the true arrangement, and tell
how it was found.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Well, whatever bit of a wise man’s work is honestly and
benevolently done, that bit is his book, or his piece of art.
But, again, I ask you, do you at all believe in honesty
or at all in kindness, or do you think there is never any
honesty or benevolence in wise people? If you read rightly,
you will easily discover the true bits, and those <i>are</i> the book.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Change either the grammatical
construction or the order of words wherever you
think such change will increase the coherence of
the following paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“We were coasting down chapel hill. In western
New York, this is one of many similar long hills.
This state is indeed a coaster’s paradise in many
parts. The particular paradise I speak of, saw,
however, a disastrous fall of a brave young Adam
and a gentle young Eve. Williams, I mean by
this, who was coming like a meteor down the hill,
with Miss —— in front of him on the “bob-sled,”
as he reached the bridge, was thrown out of the
track. Luckless bridge! it ought to have been
guarded by stout rails. There were no rails, however,
and across the narrow canyon, Williams, with
his precious charge, took a flying leap. On the
other side of it, five feet below, was a wooden abutment.
The lives of the young people were saved
by this; for the sled shot across the gulf and
landed on the projection. We picked the adventurers
up from this perilous perch. They were
more surprised than hurt. But after he had time
to think, Williams confessed that he was never
more frightened in his life; for he thought of the
thirty feet of space below that wooden ledge.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ON CORRECTNESS IN CHOICE OF WORDS</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Authority.</b>—If the art of writing is the art of
saying what we mean, we must use words that the
reader will understand. Of course the word <i>reader</i>
is rather general: there are readers and readers.
An article written for adults would show different
words from one written for children. For the purposes
of this chapter, our typical reader is the
American or the Englishman who has a good public
school training. This “average man” may in
theory happen to live in London, or in Maine,
or, again, in Texas. Now, there are certain
words used in Texas that are not used in London
or in Maine. In parts of New Jersey and
Pennsylvania a small pail is called a “blickey.”
Most natives of Chicago never heard the word.
Such words as “blickey” are called <i>provincialisms</i>
or <i>localisms</i>, and are ruled out. Our words must
be <i>national</i>. This need not mean international;
many words are used in England that need not
be used in America, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The American
speaks of <i>switching</i> a train; the Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
speaks of <i>shunting</i> it. With the former the train
goes up a steep <i>grade</i>; with the latter it goes
up a <i>gradient</i>. The Englishman calls <i>baggage</i>, <i>luggage</i>,
a word that Americans are more likely to
use of those pieces only that can be carried in the
hand. It is to be presumed that national differences
of this sort are known to American and
Englishman alike; therefore there is no reason
why either should change from the usage of his
country. Good English is essentially the same in
all English-speaking countries.</p>

<p>One other matter is suggested by the words <i>national
usage</i>. A nation is composed of all sorts
and conditions of men. Each class, each trade and
profession, has its own pet expressions and contractions.
Good usage does not recognize these.
The dialect of the college, or the ball-ground, or
the counting-room, or the law-courts, is racy enough
and proper enough in its place; but it has no place
in standard English. A student may <i>flunk</i>, but
only in school. A book of accounts can be <i>posted</i>,
but not a man.</p>

<p>Again, our words must not be so old-fashioned or
obsolete that they are unintelligible. They must
be <i>present</i>. <i>Let</i> once meant “to hinder.” Naturally
no one would use it in this sense to-day.</p>

<p>Many words that are both national and present
are not permitted, since they are not <i>reputable</i>.
They are used, but wrongly so; used by the careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and the uneducated. A great number of
such expressions are perfectly well understood
wherever English is spoken, but if one employs
them one will be set down as careless or ignorant;
for example, <i>ain’t</i> is intelligible to all, but its use
is known to be a mark of vulgarity; such a word
is called a <i>vulgarism</i>. Most slang consists of vulgarisms,
though some slang finally becomes reputable
English. Reputable words are those employed by
the best writers. By <i>best</i> is meant writers who
have literary distinction, and who know and regard
the structure and history of English literary words.
In this day, when everybody scribbles and prints,
there are countless writers whose usage is not
really reputable. The newspapers, though they
have done much to free modern English from pedantry,
are not usually reputable in usage. The
English of very many novelists is in bad repute.
Even certain writers of eminence, such as Dickens
and Thomas Hughes, are guilty of using unreputable
words and senses of words. Such essayists
as Matthew Arnold and John Fiske; such writers
of fiction as Thackeray, Hawthorne, Stevenson,
and Henry James; such historians as Green and
Parkman—these men are in general safe models
in matters of usage.</p>

<p>To sum up, then; if we would be understood, and
would be reckoned as educated persons, we must
use words that are reputable, national, and present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<i>Good usage is the employment of such words and,
senses of words as the body of reputable writers sanction
by their own practice to-day.</i> Notice that <i>the
body</i> of reputable writers is specified. No one
author makes good use, any more than one swallow
makes a summer. When a critic wishes to prove
by authority that a given expression is English, he
must be able to quote it from many authors.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Dictionary.</b>—A dictionary is a codification
of good usage. Indeed, a large dictionary codifies
also much bad usage, explaining in the
case of the latter the particular form of badness,
whether local usage, or colloquial usage, or vulgar
usage. Such a dictionary also outlines the history
of each word, so far as this is known; it can here
be learned what was standard English yesterday,
what three centuries ago. A dictionary habit is
indispensable to every one. When in doubt about
the present meaning or pronunciation of a word,
or curious as to its history, look it up. Have an
abridged dictionary of your own,—the less abridged
the better,—but consult also the unabridged books
frequently. Every author rediscovers the charm
that lies in the dictionary. To find that charm,
every word of the given explanations should be
read, and the system of <i>diacritical marks</i>, which
show syllabification, accent, vowel, and consonant
sounds, should be studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Barbarisms.</b>—Lord Chesterfield writes to his son:
“The first thing you should attend to is, to speak
whatever language you do speak, in its greatest
purity, and according to the rules of grammar; for
we must never offend against grammar, nor make
use of words which are not really words.”</p>

<p>A word that is not in a good dictionary, or is
there branded as provincial or as vulgar, is not
really a word, and should not be used. An expression
that has not been recognized by good
use is called a <i>barbarism</i>. Often such terms are
incorrectly formed, as when they are coined by
ignorant persons; often they are corruptions of
words. <i>Motorneer</i> is wrongly coined; <i>slick</i> is corrupted
from <i>sleek</i>. <i>Motorneer</i> is made up of <i>motor</i>
plus the ending <i>er</i>. The <i>ne</i> is left over from the
discarded steam engine, for <i>motorneer</i> is made by
false analogy from <i>engineer</i>. The proper word is
<i>motorman</i>. If there is need for a new word in the
language,—and the need often arises in these days
of invention,—its component parts should be from
the same tongue, and it should be formed by strict
analogy, on the model of some correct, accepted
word. Examine such a word as <i>shadowgraph</i>,
which the more careless newspapers began to use
as soon as the “Roentgen rays” were discovered.
<i>Shadow</i> is English; <i>graph</i> is Greek,—a termination
that should be added only to a Greek word.
Various correct formations have been proposed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the ray-picture—<i>scotograph</i>, <i>radiograph</i>, <i>skiagraph</i>,
etc. It remains to be seen which one of these
words will become established. Examine the word
<i>electrocution</i>. It is formed on the false analogy of
<i>execution</i>. <i>Execution</i> is from the Latin <i>ex</i> + <i>sequor</i>,
meaning “to follow up,” or, so to speak, “to chase
down.” The man who invented <i>electrocution</i> could
not have known that <i>sequor</i> was a part of <i>execution</i>.
He merely tied together <i>electro</i> and <i>cution</i>, thinking
perhaps that <i>cution</i> meant cutting or killing. <i>Electro</i>
is from the Greek (meaning “amber,” the
substance by rubbing which some one discovered
electricity), and in strictness should not be joined
to a Latin termination, even if that be correct. We
might easily have had a good English word for
death in the electrical chair; but as matters stand,
there is no one recognized word for this idea.</p>

<p>Other barbarisms are: <i>burglarize</i>, <i>to enthuse</i> (a
bad coinage from <i>enthusiasm</i>), <i>an invite</i>, <i>double
entendre</i> and <i>nom de plume</i> (two expressions which
are neither accepted French nor accepted English),
<i>walkist</i>, <i>a combine</i>, <i>preventative</i> (for <i>preventive</i>), <i>reportorial</i>,
<i>managerial</i>, <i>to suicide</i>, <i>gent</i>, <i>pants</i> (the trade
name, but not the literary), <i>photo</i>, <i>prof.</i>, <i>spoonsful</i>.
Words brought into the English from other languages,
and not yet recognized by good use, are
also barbarisms. Such words are said to be not
yet <i>Anglicized</i>. They are referred to as <i>alienisms</i>,
and most may be classified as Latinisms, Hellenisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
(or Greek words), Teutonisms (chiefly German
words), Gallicisms (French words). A word peculiar
to America is an <i>Americanism</i>; one peculiar to
England is a <i>Briticism</i>. Some Americanisms and
Briticisms are not really barbarisms, but are warranted
by the canon of national use.</p>

<p>The following words are as yet alienisms: <i>artiste</i>,
<i>sobriquet</i>, <i>beau monde</i>, <i>faux pas</i>, <i>entre nous</i>, etc.
Certain other words are Anglicized: <i>amateur</i>, <i>omelette</i>,
<i>etiquette</i>, <i>litterateur</i>, etc. The temptation to
sprinkle foreign words unnecessarily into one’s
English reaches most persons sooner or later. It
should be withstood. The English language is rich
enough to furnish forth any man’s vocabulary.</p>

<p>Many words that may finally become good
English are not yet accepted. To be on the
safe side one should say: <i>point of view</i>, not <i>standpoint</i>;
<i>upon</i>, not <i>onto</i>; <i>written permission</i>, not <i>a
permit</i>; <i>he doesn’t</i>, not <i>he don’t</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In the list given above it is remarked of <i>pants</i>
that it is a trade name (for what are ordinarily
known as trousers or pantaloons). Commercial
English and literary English are two different
things; and while a careful novelist would hardly
write about <i>wheatena</i>, or <i>flexibone</i>, or <i>autoharp</i>, he
might talk about them in the shops. Yet these
words are not correctly formed; and the same
thing is unhappily true of other trade names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Improprieties.</b>—Suppose, now, that a writer uses
a good English word, but uses it in a sense not
found in the best authors. In this case he uses
the word improperly; he commits an <i>impropriety</i>.
Sometimes two words sound so much alike that
they are mistaken one for the other; for instance,
<i>accept</i> and <i>except</i>. Sometimes the two words mean
nearly the same thing, and so come to be confused;
for example, <i>continual</i> and <i>continuous</i>. The following
list gives the words that are most frequently
mistaken for each other. In the illustrative sentences
each such word is correctly used, and in all
cases the other word would be incorrect or at least
less desirable if substituted for it.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Nouns</span></h3>

<h4>Ability, capacity.</h4>

<p>1. The <i>capacity</i> of man’s memory is great.</p>

secrets of success.</p>

<p>What idea do these words share?</p>

<h4>Acceptance, acceptation.</h4>

<p>1. His <i>acceptance</i> was graceful.</p>

<p>2. You use the word in its usual <i>acceptation</i>.</p>

<p>Each of these words contains the idea to <i>take</i>.
In what sense may this be said?</p>

<h4>Access, accession.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Access</i> to the director is easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The library has received an <i>accession</i> of books.</p>

<p>3. She was seized with an <i>access</i> of grief.</p>

<p>4. The Tsar celebrated his <i>accession</i> to the
throne.</p>

<p>Each of these words contains the idea of <i>entrance</i>.
<i>Access</i> means the entrance of a person into a room
or into the presence of another; also the entrance
of a flood of emotion into the mind. <i>Accession</i>
means the entrance of a person into the rights of
a position; also the entrance of books or other objects
to a collection,—an addition to the collection.</p>

<h4>Act, action.</h4>

<p>1. Character is developed by <i>action</i>.</p>

<p>2. Our own <i>acts</i> for good or ill speak for us.</p>

<p>Explain how both these words hold the idea

<h4>Avocation, vocation.</h4>

<p>1. My regular calling, or <i>vocation</i>, is teaching;
but for an <i>avocation</i> I spend my holidays in photography.</p>

<p>2. Dr. Weir Mitchell is a physician; but his
regular <i>vocation</i> of medicine doesn’t prevent him
from following the delightful <i>avocation</i> of letters.</p>

<p>Both these words have the idea of <i>calling</i>. Explain
how they differ. (What does <i>ab</i> mean in
Latin?)</p>

<h4>Balance, remainder.</h4>

<p>1. The <i>balance</i> of the sum is due.</p>

<p>2. The <i>remainder</i> of the day is spent.</p>

<p>Character is what a man ——; reputation is
what people —— of him.</p>

<h4>Compliment, complement.</h4>

<p>1. Woman’s mind is by many considered the
<i>complement</i> of man’s, supplying certain things that
the masculine mind has not.</p>

<p>2. His <i>compliments</i> are really <i>flatteries</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The secretary supplied the army with its
<i>complement</i> of stores.</p>

<h4>Council, counsel.</h4>

<p>1. His <i>counsel</i> defended him in the trial.</p>

<p>2. Let good <i>counsel</i> prevail.</p>

<p>3. The <i>council</i> of ten gave good <i>counsel</i>.</p>

<p>Define these two words. What idea have they
in common?</p>

<h4>Falseness, falsity.</h4>

<p>Arnold was a traitor; and the <i>falseness</i> of his
character was proved by the <i>falsity</i> of his statements.</p>

<p>What idea do these words share? Frame definitions.</p>

<h4>Invention, discovery.</h4>

<p>Edison <i>discovered</i> certain laws of sound and
by them <i>invented</i> the phonograph. This <i>invention</i>
is not as yet very useful; but the <i>discovery</i> of the
laws was important.</p>

<p>What idea do these words share? Frame definitions.</p>

<h4>Limit, limitation.</h4>

<p>1. There should be no <i>limitation</i> of the commander’s
authority.</p>

<p>2. There were no <i>limits</i> to his delight.</p>

each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<h4>Majority, plurality.</h4>

<p>A <i>majority</i> is more than half the whole number.
A <i>plurality</i> is the excess of votes received
by one candidate above another. When there are
several candidates, the one who receives more votes
than any other has a plurality.</p>

<p>In what respect are these words alike in meaning?
in what unlike?</p>

<h4>Observation, observance.</h4>

<p>1. His <i>observation</i> of the habits of birds was keen.</p>

<p>2. His <i>observance</i> of the Sabbath was strict.</p>

<p>Is <i>watch</i> the best word for the idea shared by
these words? Discuss.</p>

<h4>Observation, remark.</h4>

<p>1. Johnson’s <i>observations</i> of men were keen.</p>

<p>2. Johnson’s <i>observations</i> were made with his
eyes; his <i>remarks</i>, with his tongue; and Boswell,
by recording the remarks, recorded the <i>observations</i>.</p>

<p>What relation has a <i>remark</i> to an <i>observation</i>?</p>

<h4>Party, person.</h4>

<p>1. A <i>party</i> in a silk hat must be a party of Liliputians.</p>

<p>2. The <i>party</i> of the first part was two <i>persons</i>.</p>

<p>3. A seedy <i>person</i> joined the party.</p>

<p>4. I refuse to be a <i>party</i> to the deed.</p>

<p>Is the idea of a <i>part</i> always contained in the
word <i>party</i>? Discuss.</p>

<h4>Part, portion.</h4>

<p>1. Esau sold his <i>portion</i>, the part allotted him.</p>

<p>2. The human body has many <i>parts</i>.</p>

<p>3. Waiter, one <i>portion</i> of roast beef will do!</p>

<p>What is a <i>portion</i>?</p>

<h4>Prominent, predominant.</h4>

<p>There were many <i>prominent</i> men in Lincoln’s
cabinet, but the President was always <i>predominant</i>
among them.</p>

<p>Consult the unabridged as to the origin of these
words.</p>

<h4>Recipe, receipt.</h4>

<p>If <i>receipt</i> comes from the Latin meaning “taken,”
it is easy to see why when money is taken a <i>receipt</i>
is given. <i>Recipe</i> is a Latin imperative, meaning
“take”; naturally it is the right word for a formula
in cooking; “take” so much salt, so much meal,
so much water—and lo! a johnny cake.</p>

<h4>Relative, relation.</h4>

<p>One may have many <i>relatives</i> with whom he
does not keep up close <i>relations</i>.</p>

<p>Is <i>relation</i> preferably an abstract noun, or a concrete?</p>

<h4>Residence, house.</h4>

<p>1. Do not say <i>residence</i> when you mean house;

<h4>Accept, except.</h4>

<p>1. All Cretans are liars, runs the proverb: the
proverb <i>excepts</i> none.</p>

<p>2. He <i>accepted</i> the invitation.</p>

<p>Both words have the idea of <i>take</i>. How is this
true of except?</p>

<h4>Affect, effect.</h4>

<p>1. Even the rumor <i>affected</i> his belief, changing
it slightly.</p>

<p>2. He <i>effected</i> a junction with the other army.</p>

release</i>? <i>destruction</i>? <i>conscience</i>? <i>peace of mind</i>?
Which one of the two words requires for an object
a noun expressing an action?</p>

<h4>Aggravate, irritate, tantalize.</h4>

<p>1. Tantalus was <i>tantalized</i> by the sight of inaccessible
fruit.</p>

<p>2. He <i>aggravates</i> the difficulty by trying to excuse
his act.</p>

his Country.</p>

the work; then he went back to his duties, not
<i>alluding</i> to the subject again.</p>

<p>Can a person <i>allude</i> to a thing without assuming
knowledge of it on the part of an audience? Can
a thing be <i>alluded</i> to for the first time? if so, would
it be the first time it was spoken of? Make <i>allusions</i>
to several great men without <i>mentioning</i> their
names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>1. By <i>antagonizing</i> the views of his friends, he
<i>alienated</i> their sympathies from him.</p>

<p>2. He <i>alienated</i> his friends by <i>antagonizing</i> them.</p>

ordinarily.</p>

<h4>Bring, fetch.</h4>

<p>1. Come here and <i>bring</i> the book.</p>

<p>2. Go and <i>fetch</i> the book.</p>

<p>Define these two words. What is their common
idea?</p>

<h4>Claim, assert, etc.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Claim</i> means to assert a right to a thing as
one’s own. It means neither <i>to say</i>, <i>to assert</i>, <i>to
declare</i>, <i>to maintain</i>, <i>to hold</i>, <i>to allege</i>, nor <i>to contend</i>.</p>

<p>2. He <i>claims</i> the right to be heard.</p>

<p>3. He <i>maintains</i> that he ought to be heard.</p>

<p>1. Being in disgrace, the captain was <i>degraded</i>
from his rank.</p>

<p>3. He <i>debases</i> [or <i>degrades</i>] himself by his
profanity.</p>

<p>Give a synonym for <i>demean</i>.</p>

<h4>Drive, ride.</h4>

<p>In England one <i>rides</i> only when one is on horseback;
one is said to <i>drive</i> if in a carriage. In
America one <i>drives</i> when one holds the reins; but
we <i>go driving</i> even when the coachman drives.
There is also excellent authority for <i>take a ride</i>,
and <i>go riding</i>, when conveyance in a carriage is
meant.</p>

<h4>Endorse, approve, second.</h4>

<p>1. He <i>seconded</i> all his friend’s propositions.</p>

<p>2. He <i>endorsed</i> the check across the top.</p>

<p>3. He <i>approved</i> his colleague’s act.</p>

<p>What is a <i>dorsal</i> fin? What does <i>endorse</i> mean,
by etymology?</p>

<h4>Got, gotten, have.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Got</i> is perhaps preferable to <i>gotten</i>.</p>

<p>2. Don’t say you’ve <i>got</i> a thing when you merely
<i>have it</i>, without having secured it.</p>

<p>What idea is common to <i>get</i> and <i>have</i>?</p>

<h4>Guess, think, reckon.</h4>

<p>1. I <i>think</i> I shall go.</p>

<p>2. He <i>reckoned</i> the cost before he started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>3. I <i>guess</i> there are a hundred.</p>

<p>[The habitual misuse of <i>guess</i> is an American
fault.]</p>

<h4>Intend, calculate.</h4>

<p>1. She received his apologies with a resentment
they were <i>likely</i>, but were not intended, to inspire.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>2. He aimed at the animal a blow <i>calculated</i> to
kill it.</p>

<p>3. I fully <i>intend</i> to go, but cannot <i>calculate</i> how
soon.</p>

<h4>Let, leave.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Let</i> me be! Don’t bother me when I want to
study.</p>

<p>2. <i>Let</i> me alone!</p>

<p>3. <i>Leave</i> me alone here.</p>

<p>4. <i>Let</i> go! Unhand me.</p>

<p><i>Let</i> once meant “to hinder.” Now it means the
opposite—“permit.”</p>

<h4>Lie, lay.</h4>

<p>The chief trouble with the first of these two
words seems to concern the past tense: “He <i>laid
down</i> on the sofa.”</p>

<h4>Locate, settle.</h4>

<p>1. He <i>located his house</i> there (not <i>located there</i>).</p>

<p>2. He <i>settled</i> in Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h4>Loan, lend.</h4>

<p>It is not incorrect to use <i>loan</i> in the sense of <i>lend</i>,
but <i>lend</i> is the less formal and the preferable word.</p>

<h4>May, can.</h4>

<p><i>May</i> it not be said that any person who has not
learned the difference between these two words,
<i>can</i> hardly be permitted to call himself a user of
good English?</p>

<p>It is not hard to see why people confuse these
two words. Often the questioner feels that, for all
practicable purposes, the refusal of his request will
make a barrier over which he <i>cannot</i> go. When he
says “Can I go,” he is feeling, “Will you make it
possible for me to go? for unless you consent I
cannot go—I cannot afford to, or I cannot conscientiously,
or I cannot and remain on right terms
with you.” Nevertheless, <i>may</i> is the only right
word to use in asking permission.</p>

<h4>Proved, proven.</h4>

<p>1. The point was not <i>proved</i>.</p>

<p>2. Verdict: “Not proven.” <i>Proven</i> is a Scotch
legal term, wrongly supposed by some persons to
be preferable to <i>proved</i> out of the court-room.</p>

<h4>Purpose, propose.</h4>

<p>1. One can’t <i>propose</i> unless he proposes something
to somebody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>2. One can <i>purpose</i> to do a thing, without <i>proposing</i>
it to any one.</p>

<p>How do both these words contain the idea of
<i>placing</i>?</p>

<h4>Sit, set.</h4>

<p>The chief errors in the use of <i>sit</i> and <i>set</i> are
two. Some people insist on saying “<i>setting hen</i>”
for “<i>sitting hen</i>,” and “the coat <i>sets</i> well” for “<i>sits</i>
well.” A few say, “<i>Sit</i> yourself down,” for the
somewhat old-fashioned “<i>sit</i> you down” (where
the <i>you</i> is nominative) or for “<i>set</i> yourself down.”
Similarly this error has been known to occur—“he
sat the basket of eggs down.”</p>

<h4>Stay, stop.</h4>

<p>1. He <i>stopped</i> at Albany; he went no farther.</p>

<p>2. At what hotel are you <i>staying</i>, these days?</p>

<h4>Transpire, happen.</h4>

<p>A good many things <i>happened</i> that dark night
when the boys were out for a lark; but it never
<i>transpired</i> what really did happen; nothing leaked
out or got to the light.</p>

<p><i>Spiro</i> means “to breathe.” <i>Trans</i> (across) when
in composition means through, out. Is it not clear
how the present use of the word comes about?
Explain. Compare the words <i>expire</i>, <i>conspire</i>, <i>inspire</i>.
How does each get its present meaning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<h4>Wish, want, desire.</h4>

<p>1. It is sometimes correct enough to say <i>want</i> in
the place of <i>wish</i>.</p>

<p>2. You shall <i>want</i> nothing; all shall be supplied.</p>

<p>3. You shall not want anything you may <i>desire</i>.</p>

<p>Which idea springs out of the other—<i>want</i> from
<i>wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> from <i>want</i>?</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Adjectives and Adverbs</span></h3>

<h4>Apt, likely, liable.</h4>

<p>1. He is <i>apt</i> at languages.</p>

<p>2. He is <i>likely</i> to fail if he does not properly
prepare himself. [Here <i>apt</i> was possible, but not
so good as <i>likely</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Apt</i> means “fitted,” “fit.” How could such an
idea as “It is <i>apt</i> to rain this month” spring from
the idea of <i>fit</i>?</p>

<p>3. He is <i>likely</i> to succeed if only he tries.</p>

<p>4. He is <i>liable</i> to arrest and quarantine,—though
not <i>likely</i> to be arrested,—merely because he is
<i>liable</i> to come down with a contagious disease.</p>

<p>With what kind of feeling does a person look
forward to a thing to which he is <i>liable</i>?</p>

<h4>Continual, continuous.</h4>

<p>1. A <i>continual</i> dropping is a Biblical phrase.</p>

<p>2. A <i>continuous</i> dropping would not be a dropping
at all. It would be a stream.</p>

<p>What idea have these words in common?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h4>Funny, odd.</h4>

<p>1. It is <i>odd</i> that I haven’t heard of this before.</p>

<p>2. It is a <i>funny</i> sight to see Fido trying desperately
to catch his own tail.</p>

<p>Can you explain something of the mental process
by which a child comes to say <i>funny</i> so frequently,
and <i>strange</i> so rarely? Is it all a matter of imitation,
or is there some other reason? Are there
not more of <i>strange</i> things in a child’s experience
than of <i>funny</i> things?</p>

<h4>Healthy, healthful.</h4>

<p><i>Healthful</i> food makes a <i>healthy</i> man.</p>

<p>Give a synonym for <i>healthful</i> as applied to
food.</p>

<h4>Imminent, eminent, immanent.</h4>

<p>1. The <i>eminent</i> Latin writer, Livy, speaks of
Hannibal’s elephants as looming up—<i>eminentes</i>—through
the mist.</p>

<p>2. That God is <i>immanent</i> in all the world was
a doctrine of the Greek fathers; they meant that
he pervades and is diffused throughout it.</p>

<p>3. The sword of Damocles hung <i>imminent</i>, suspended
by a hair.</p>

<p>4. He is in <i>imminent</i> danger of disgrace.</p>

<p>With which two of these words is the idea of
<i>threaten</i> connected? Which has the idea of <i>remain</i>,
or <i>stay</i>, in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<h4>In, into.</h4>

<p>1. Bruno looked up <i>into</i> his master’s face.</p>

<p>2. He got <i>into</i> the chariot.</p>

<p>3. He sprang <i>into</i> the lake, while I stayed <i>in</i>
the boat.</p>

<p>4. Once <i>in</i> the lake, he swam round.</p>

<p>What difference in the use of these words?</p>

<h4>Last, latest.</h4>

<p>1. The <i>last</i> page of the book is done.</p>

<p>2. The <i>latest</i> news from the patient is bad.</p>

<p>Does <i>latest</i> imply anything as to the future?</p>

<h4>Last, preceding.</h4>

<p>1. Let each paragraph be joined smoothly with
the <i>preceding</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>last</i> paragraph ends the theme.</p>

<h4>Mad, angry.</h4>

<p>1. There is no reason for being <i>angry</i>.</p>

<p>2. Much learning hath made thee <i>mad</i>.</p>

<p>3. He was <i>mad</i> with rage—fairly insane.</p>

<p>1. <i>Most</i> men are optimists.</p>

<p>2. <i>Almost</i> every man loves praise.</p>

<p>Parse the words italicized above.</p>

<h4>Mutual, common.</h4>

<p>1. Our <i>common</i> friend is the better expression,
though Dickens has made famous the corresponding
worse usage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Friendship may be <i>mutual</i>; a friend cannot.</p>

<p>3. Separated by mountains and by <i>mutual</i> fear.</p>

<p>What is meant by reciprocal? Which word is
a synonym of reciprocal?</p>

<h4>Oral, verbal.</h4>

<p>1. Miles Standish’s act of sending the Indians
a snake-skin filled with powder and ball, was a
message, but not a <i>verbal</i> message.</p>

<p>2. If you are to see John, let me send him this
<i>oral</i> message: Never say die.</p>

<p>3. The corrections did not affect the truth of
the statements, but only the manner: they were
<i>verbal</i> corrections.</p>

<p>4. The telegraph operator translates into <i>verbal</i>
form the message that he hears in the ticking of
his receiver.</p>

<p>The Latin word <i>os</i> means mouth; the Latin
word <i>verbum</i> means a word. Do <i>oral</i> and <i>verbal</i>
keep the sense of the Latin words? Can a verbal
message be oral? Can an oral message be verbal?
Is an oral message ordinarily verbal? Can you
imagine an oral message that is not verbal?</p>

<h4>Posted, informed.</h4>

<p>1. The ledger is well <i>posted</i>.</p>

<p>2. The editor is well <i>informed</i>.</p>

<p>Can you see the slightest reasonable advantage in
speaking of a person as well <i>posted</i>? In other words,
does this commercial slang lend any real force?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h4>Practicable, practical.</h4>

<p>His scheme won’t work; it isn’t <i>practicable</i>. I’m
afraid he isn’t so <i>practical</i> a schemer as we thought.</p>

<h4>Quite, somewhat, very, rather, entirely, wholly.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Quite</i> never means “very,” “rather,” or
“somewhat.” It means “wholly.”</p>

<p>2. Harry is <i>quite</i> well; he is never sick.</p>

<p>3. Yes, I like him <i>rather</i> well.</p>

<p>4. Thank you; I’m <i>quite</i> myself again.</p>

<p>Curtail <i>quite</i>, and you get another good English
adjective from the same root. How is this shorter
word related in sense to the longer? With which
of the following expressions can <i>quite</i> be used?
Well (adj.), sick, recovered, pretty, finished, settled,
nice, good, assured, patient, used up, satisfied, a

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—The following sentences are from
John Ruskin. No improprieties occur in the originals.
Within each pair of brackets a word is given,
sometimes the right word, sometimes the wrong
word. Study the meaning of each sentence, and
satisfy yourself as to what is the best expression
for each place in question.</p>

<p>1. The ennobling difference between one man
and another—between one animal and another—is
precisely in this, that one feels more than another.
If we were sponges, perhaps sensation
might not be easily [gotten] for us; if we were
earth-worms, [apt] at every instant to be cut in
two by the spade, perhaps too much sensation
might not be good for us.</p>

<p>2. But chiefly of all, she is taught to extend
the [limitations] of her sympathy.</p>

<p>3. Very ready we are to say of a book, “How
good this is—that’s exactly what I think!” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the right feeling is, “How [odd] that is! I never
thought of that before, and yet I see it is true;
or if I do not now, I hope I shall some day.”</p>

<p>4. I believe, then, with this exception, that a
girl’s education should be nearly, in its course and
material of study, the same as a boy’s; but [entirely]
differently directed. A woman in any rank
of life ought to know whatever her husband is
[liable] to know, but to know it in a different way.</p>

<p>5. I do not blame them for this, but only for
their narrow motive in this. I would have them
[want] and [assert] the title of “lady” provided
they [allege] not merely the title, but the office
and duty signified by it.</p>

<p>6. And not less wrong—perhaps even more
foolishly wrong (for I will [expect] thus far what
I hope to prove)—is the idea that woman is only
the shadow and attendant image of her lord.</p>

<p>7. But now, having no true [avocation], we pour
our whole masculine energy into the false business
of money-making.</p>

<p>8. Having then faithfully listened to the great
teachers, that you may enter into their thoughts,
you have yet this higher [advancement] to make,—you
have to enter into their hearts.</p>

<p>9. And, lastly, a great nation does not mock
Heaven and its Powers by pretending belief in
a revelation which [asserts] the love of money
to be the root of <i>all</i> evil, and [claiming], at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
same time that it is actuated, and [proposes] to be
actuated, in all chief national deeds and measures,
by no other love.</p>

<p>10. But an education “which shall keep a good
coat on my son’s back; which shall [capacitate]
him to ring with confidence the visitors’ bell at
double-belled doors; which shall result ultimately
in the establishment of a double-belled door to
his own [residence]—in a word, which shall lead
to [advance] in life—<i>this</i> we pray for on bent
knees; and this is <i>all</i> we pray for.” It never
seems to occur to the parents that there may be
an education which in itself <i>is</i> [advance] in Life;
that any other than that may perhaps be [advancement]
in Death; and that this essential education
might be more easily [gotten] or given, than they
[guess], if they set about it in the right way, while
it is for no price and by no favor to be [got], if
they set about it in the wrong.</p>

<p>11. The chance and scattered evil that may here
and there haunt, or hide itself in, a powerful book,
never does any harm to a noble girl; but the emptiness
of an author oppresses her, and his amiable
folly [degrades] her. And if she can have [access]
to a good library of old and classical books,
there need be no choosing at all. Keep the modern
magazine and novel out of your girl’s way; turn
her loose into the old library every day, and [let]
her alone.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>The English Vocabulary.</b>—The enormous treasure
of English speech contains something like 200,000
words.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Most of these were once foreigners
to the language. To tell how each came to be
English would be like telling the personal romances
of all the foreign-born citizens of these
United States.</p>

<p>England was once inhabited by Celts, the ancestors
of the Scotch, Welsh, and Irish. The
Romans under Cæsar possessed the island, and for
five hundred years held the country, but they left
us, from this period of their occupation, only half
a dozen words: the names of the camp (<i>castra</i>),
the paved road (<i>strata</i>), the settlement (<i>colonia</i>),
the trench (<i>fossa</i>), the harbor (<i>portus</i>), the rampart
(<i>vallum</i>). These words remain chiefly in the names
of places. A sharp eye sees them in Lancaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Leicester, Manchester, etc.; Stratford, street, etc.;
Lincoln, etc.; Fossway, etc.; Portsmouth, etc.;
wall, bailey, bailiff (these three words being derived
from <i>vallum</i>).</p>

<p>In the fifth century, however, Teutonic tribes
began to cross the sea and invade the land. The
Celts were driven north and west into the mountains,
and the newcomers stayed permanently.
Although these Teutons—the Anglo-Saxons—called
the Celts <i>Welsh</i>, that is, strangers, they took
up a good many of the strangers’ words. They
called many a river of the land <i>Avon</i>, water, as the
Celts had done,—there are fourteen Avons to-day,—and
they kept many such words as <i>inch</i>, an
island (in Inchcape), and <i>kill</i>, a church (in Kildare).
Indeed, for centuries the Celts kept on lending
words to the English: <i>bargain</i>, <i>bodkin</i>, <i>brogue</i>, <i>clan</i>,
<i>crag</i>, <i>dagger</i>, <i>glen</i>, <i>gown</i>, <i>mitten</i>, <i>rogue</i>, <i>whiskey</i>, are
familiar examples of these permanent loans.</p>

<p>The Old English language itself was a Germanic
dialect. Like Latin and German, it was inflected,—a
fact that we see to-day in the presence of such
forms as <i>him</i>, the old dative case for <i>he</i>. The inflectional
endings nearly all disappeared before
Shakespeare’s time. The vocabulary of this Old
English has given us most of the words that we
use as children. For example, household names—<i>home</i>,
<i>friends</i>, <i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, etc.; names of many
emotions—<i>gladness</i>, <i>sorrow</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>hate</i>, <i>fear</i>, etc.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
names of most objects in the landscape—<i>tree</i>, <i>bush</i>,
<i>stone</i>, <i>hill</i>, <i>woods</i>, <i>stream</i>, <i>sun</i>, <i>moon</i>, etc.; common
names of animals—<i>horse</i>, <i>cow</i>, <i>dog</i>, <i>cat</i>, etc.; parts
of the body—<i>head</i>, <i>eye</i>, etc. Our household proverbs
are in these Anglo-Saxon words. “Fast bind,
fast find,” is an example of a thousand similar saws
that embody the practical common sense of the
people. The loves and hates, the hopes and fears,
the wit and rude wisdom of our forefathers, have
gone into Saxon words. These are not merely
the words of childhood; in hours of deep feeling,
in moments when the natural disposition demands
expression, the grown man speaks in Saxon. These
strong, forcible old words are to be prized and
cherished as carefully as are those of less emotional
suggestion,—the exact, discriminative Latin words.</p>

<p>In the ninth and tenth centuries the Norse
vikings, who sailed everywhere, sailed also to England,
and for a time got the upper hand of the
Saxons. From 1013 to 1042 there were Scandinavian
kings on the English throne. But these Norse
were not able to impose much of their own language
upon the country. Their settlements were
named in Norse, and the word <i>by</i>, a town, remains
in hundreds of such places, as <i>Whitby</i>, the <i>white
town</i> (from the white cliffs). From these great
seamen our Saxon ancestors learned some new
nautical dialect—words like <i>bow</i>, <i>bowline</i>, <i>crew</i>,
<i>harbor</i>, <i>hawser</i>, <i>lee</i>, <i>stern</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1066 the Normans conquered the land. These
were Frenchmen whose fathers had been Norse.
They brought the French language into their English
court, and for two or three hundred years
there were two languages in England,—French
on the lips of the nobles, Saxon on the lips of
the peasants. But the Saxon race was too strong
to remain an underling. Gradually it mingled
with the Norman race, picking up hundreds, even
thousands of French words from the latter, but
keeping its own ways of putting words together.</p>

<p>By 1400, when Chaucer died, there was a new
English language, almost as much French as Saxon
in vocabulary, but far less French than Saxon in
grammar. Since French is largely derived from
Latin, it is clear that the total Latin element in
the vocabulary was already very great.</p>

<p>After Chaucer there came a general awakening
of interest in ancient civilization; and in the
Revival of Learning a great many words were
adopted directly from Latin and Greek. In the
sixteenth century followed the Renaissance of literature,
art, and the sciences. This made its way
to England from Italy, and naturally Englishmen
caught up many new words from Italians.
For example: <i>alert</i>, <i>bankrupt</i>, <i>brigade</i>, <i>bust</i>, <i>cameo</i>,
<i>caricature</i>, <i>cascade</i>, <i>domino</i>, <i>fresco</i>, <i>granite</i>, <i>influenza</i>,
<i>malaria</i>, <i>niche</i>, <i>oratorio</i>, <i>pianoforte</i>, <i>ruffian</i>, <i>studio</i>,
<i>tirade</i>, <i>umbrella</i>, <i>vista</i>. The Spaniards, too, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Englishmen met in those days on the sea and at
courts, have lent our language such words as <i>barricade</i>,
<i>bravado</i>, <i>cigar</i>, <i>desperado</i>, <i>flotilla</i>, <i>guerilla</i>,
<i>merino</i>, <i>mosquito</i>, <i>mulatto</i>, <i>renegade</i>, <i>sherry</i>, <i>tornado</i>,
<i>vanilla</i>.</p>

<p>The bold English seamen of the sixteenth century
sailed back even from America with new
things and new names—like <i>tobacco</i>. In the next
century the commerce which followed hard upon
the voyages of discovery was the means of bringing
to the British island many new words. Here
it may be said that the Dutch, who have rivalled
the English in commerce, and who have taught the
English some tricks of seamanship,—as did the
vikings before them,—are represented in English
by words like <i>ballast</i>, <i>boom</i>, <i>boor</i>, <i>skipper</i>, <i>sloop</i>,
<i>smack</i>, <i>trigger</i>, <i>yacht</i>. English merchantmen of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sailed to
ports Oriental and Occidental. Returning, they
brought from Africa canaries and gorillas, with
the words <i>canary</i> and <i>gorilla</i>, and told of <i>oases</i>;
from Arabia they fetched such names as <i>admiral</i>,
<i>alcohol</i>, <i>alcove</i>, <i>alkali</i>, <i>arsenal</i>, <i>azure</i>, <i>chemistry</i>,
<i>coffee</i>, <i>cotton</i>, <i>lute</i>, <i>magazine</i>, <i>nabob</i>, <i>naphtha</i>,
<i>sherbet</i>, <i>sofa</i>, <i>syrup</i>, <i>zenith</i>; indeed, some of these
words had got into English through earlier English
travellers—chiefly crusaders. English sailors
and travellers have brought from China <i>silk</i>, <i>tea</i>,
etc.; from India, <i>banyan</i>, <i>calico</i>, <i>mullagatawny</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<i>musk</i>, <i>punch</i>, <i>sugar</i>, <i>thug</i>, etc.; from Malayan ports,
<i>bantam</i>, <i>cockatoo</i>, <i>gong</i>, <i>rattan</i>, <i>sago</i>, etc.; from
Persia, <i>awning</i>, <i>caravan</i>, <i>chess</i>, <i>hazard</i>, <i>horde</i>, <i>lemon</i>,
<i>orange</i>, <i>paradise</i>, <i>sash</i>, <i>shawl</i>, etc. Few are the
languages from which a British ear has not caught
and kept a new term.</p>

<p>In America we have many Indian names of
places and things. We have <i>hominy</i>, <i>moose</i>, <i>opossum</i>,
<i>raccoon</i>, <i>toboggan</i>, and other words from North
American tribes. Mexico gave us <i>chocolate</i>, <i>tomato</i>,
etc.; the West Indies, <i>potato</i>, <i>canoe</i>, <i>hurricane</i>;
South America, <i>alpaca</i>, <i>quinine</i>, <i>tapioca</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In the present century, science, both practical
and pure, has discovered thousands of facts and
invented thousands of contrivances. Consequently
thousands of words have been coined, mostly from
Greek, to name modern inventions and the facts of
science. A recent dictionary found it necessary to
codify 4000 technical terms that had sprung up
within the last few years.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Latin Element.</b>—The Latin element is numerically
the larger part of the language. It is
therefore impossible to know well the English
vocabulary except by knowing a considerable part
of the Latin language. Whether our Latin words
come directly through the ancient classics, or
through the Romance tongues, such as French,
Italian, and Spanish, to know their full force one
must know the original meaning of them, as used
by the ancient race of world-conquerors. Every
instructor in English watches with keen interest
the progress made by his students in their Latin
studies. Of course, the mere knowledge that a
given word is derived from a given Latin word
does not necessarily give the student practical
command of it in his writing; but usually such
knowledge does help to a better understanding of
the meaning the word has to-day, and so tends
both to fix it in memory and to insure exact use
of it.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MASTERY OF A WRITING VOCABULARY</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Ideas without Words.</b>—It is possible to have
ideas without having words in which to express
them. Miss Helen Keller<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> had plenty of ideas
before any one taught her the words for them.
The painter trains himself to express ideas in
paint; the sculptor, in stone. The inventor expresses
ideas in machinery. Because words however
are the commonest means of expression, it
is desirable that one should know as many as
possible. A person who has ideas will indeed be
able to communicate them in some rough-and-ready
form of speech; will use a poor word, if he cannot
think of a good one, and by hook or crook will
manage to be understood. But an unread, untrained
man trying to communicate some fine shade
of thought is commonly a sorry sight, no matter
how bright his mind may be.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Words without Ideas.</b>—On the other hand, it is
possible to know words without knowing what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
stand for. Some persons of quick verbal memory
pick up phrases readily, and utter them glibly,
with little sense of their meaning. Gratiano, of
Shakespeare’s drama, “spoke an infinite deal of
nothing, more than any man in Venice.” Such
persons as he have given ground for the sarcastic
remark that language is the art of concealing
thought. The use of meaningless phrases, and
the use of words without a care to their exact
meaning, is one danger that besets the student of
composition. The boy who fluently remarks that
he recently lost his little <i>saturnine</i> (meaning <i>canine</i>,
i.e. <i>dog</i>); the lady, Mrs. Malaprop, who walks
through Sheridan’s play, saying, “You go first,
and we’ll <i>precede</i> you”; the man, Launcelot Gobbo,
who enlivens <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> with such remarks
as that “his suit is <i>impertinent</i> to himself,”—these
people need a book of synonyms. Unless a
writer is sure that he knows definitely the meaning
of the word that his pen is about to trace, he
would much better stay his hand.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Ideas and Words.</b>—Though one mind may have
ideas but lack their names, and though another
may have the names but lack the notions for which
they stand, yet both ideas and words are indispensable
to the writer. A general recipe for getting
ideas is hardly easier to give than a recipe
for being great, or for having blue eyes, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
being liked by every one. Ideas are had through
new experiences, new acquaintanceships, new sights;
through hard thinking, through hard reading,—in
short, through living. Mr. Henry James, the eminent
novelist, gives a direction for being a good
novelist: <i>Try to be one of those people on whom
nothing is lost.</i> The student who is eager to know
as much as possible of what is worth knowing in
life, and is devoured with curiosity to learn the
name of everything, is sure to acquire both new
ideas and new words.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It is nevertheless not to be denied that to some
extent ideas can be bred by the study of the mere
words. How true this is appears when it is remembered
that words are the embalmed ideas of men.
A study of such a list as the Curious Words given
in the preceding chapter cannot but add to the
student’s mental stores. Thackeray, it is said,
used to read the dictionary before he composed.
It may be presumed that the habit used not merely
to acquaint him with new words, but to arouse his
mind and set it to fashioning new thoughts. The
attempt to discriminate between words that mean
nearly, not quite, the same thing, results in a distinct
gain in thought, and in power of thought.
It is probable that no two words have exactly the
same sense; to discover the difference enriches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
discoverer’s store of knowledge, and develops one
of the highest mental powers. A command of
words not merely affords relief from the pain of
dumbness, not merely loosens the tongue; it aids
reasoning. Thinking proceeds more securely the
moment a hazy notion is given definite shape in
the right word. Indeed, the mere search for the
right word is always a means of clearing up the
thought. To be tortured in mind by inability to
find the unique phrase, sometimes means a mere
fault in verbal memory; as often, or oftener, it is
due to a vagueness of thinking.</p>

<p>By way of summary, then, acquisition of ideas
furthers acquisition of words, and <i>vice versâ</i>. To
be poor in ideas, or to be poor in language,—either
means failure for a writer.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Two Vocabularies.</b>—Of all the 200,000
words in our language, probably no one man would
understand one-half if he saw them, undefined, in
a dictionary. Just how large a man’s reading
vocabulary can be is not known. Professor Holden,
the astronomer, found that his own was about
33,000 words. It is therefore likely that 25,000
is not an unusual number for an educated person
to understand. But the <i>reading</i> or <i>passive</i> vocabulary
is very different in size from the <i>writing</i> or
<i>active</i> vocabulary. To remember the sense of a
word when it is seen is far less difficult than to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the word whenever its meaning rises dimly in
the mind. A little child has but one set of words—an
active vocabulary; it makes oral use of all the
expressions it knows. But the older person reads so
much that he comes to recognize myriads of words
that rarely rise to his lips or find their way to his
pen. There is inevitably therefore a widening gap
between the expressions he can recognize and those
he can employ. That this should be so is in part desirable.
A person of fourteen or sixteen or eighteen
must, if he reads carefully, learn to understand
many expressions that are too bookish for his own
uses. The word <i>temerarious</i>, for instance, is needed
once where its unpretentious cousin, <i>rash</i>, is needed
a score of times. With some words the young
writer needs only a speaking acquaintance; others
are good friends that, in Hamlet’s phrase, he should
buckle to his soul with hoops of steel. But it is
safe to say that if a person can transfer some part
of his reading vocabulary into his writing vocabulary,
he will be much benefited by so doing.
There is probably no reason why a freshman should
not enter college master of a writing vocabulary
of 5000 words, and a reading vocabulary of 15,000.
Shakespeare’s works contain about 15,000 different
words, the King James version of the Bible fewer
than 6000. Again, each person uses the same
words with many different meanings. Every great
writer employs the same words in many figurative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
senses; the fact is perhaps the most striking proof
of his literary power. If Shakespeare’s vocabulary
were reckoned as including these figurative meanings,
it would shoot up to a wonderful figure.</p>

<p>“It would be absurd,” says Professor A. S. Hill,
with characteristic good sense, “for a boy to have
the desirableness of enlarging his vocabulary constantly
on his mind; but if he avails himself of
his opportunities, in the school-room or out of it,
he will be surprised to find how rapidly his vocabulary
grows.” Doubtless however the matter must
receive some definite attention, if the best results
are to be secured. In the rest of this chapter particular
methods of acquiring new words and senses
of words will be considered.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>A Vocabulary Book.</b>—It will be found helpful
to buy a strong blank-book of convenient size, and
to copy into this every new word that seems to the
student available for his writing; not every new
word he meets, for some will impress him as too
bookish or pedantic, but those which appear to express
happily some idea that has lain unnamed in
his mind.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Figurative Uses of Common Words.</b>—A writer
owes it to himself and to the reader to get all the
service he legitimately can out of common words,
because in the end so doing spares both persons a
vast deal of unnecessary labor. Examine a handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the well-worn counters of speech,—such words
as <i>poor</i>, <i>heavy</i>, <i>thin</i>, <i>best</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>manner</i>, <i>sense</i>, <i>deep</i>,
<i>sweet</i>. They are like dull pebbles brought home
from the beach. But dip them back into the brine
of a good book, and they become gems. The words
specified above appear in a paragraph of Mr. W. D.
Howells: “I followed Irving, too, in my later reading,
but at haphazard, and with other authors at the
same time. I did my poor best to be amused by
his <i>Knickerbocker History of New York</i>, because my
father liked it so much, but secretly I found it
heavy; and a few years ago when I went carefully
through it again, I could not laugh. Even
as a boy I found some other things of his up-hill
work. There was the beautiful manner, but the
thought seemed thin; and I do not remember
having been much amused by <i>Bracebridge Hall</i>,
though I read it devoutly, and with a full sense
that it would be very <i>comme il faut</i> to like it. But
I did like the life of Goldsmith; I liked it a great
deal better than the more authoritative life by
Forster, and I think there is a deeper and sweeter
sense of Goldsmith in it.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Observe the various duties that the plainest
words were persuaded into doing for Shakespeare.
With him the word <i>old</i> applies to widely different
things: <i>Old arms</i>, <i>old beard</i>, <i>old limbs</i>, <i>old eyes</i>, <i>old
bones</i>, <i>old feet</i>, <i>old heart</i>, <i>old wrinkles</i>, <i>old wit</i>, <i>old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
care</i>, <i>old woe</i>, <i>old hate</i>, <i>old custom</i>, <i>old days</i>. What
does each of these phrases mean? He is fond of
contrasting simple words; thus, “He’ll take his
<i>old</i> course in a country <i>new</i>.”</p>

<p>Note how many abstract ideas in Shakespeare are
contented with the word <i>heavy</i>, which ordinary
people apply merely to coal, lead, and such uninspiring
commodities. <i>Heavy accent</i>, <i>heavy news</i>,
<i>heavy sin</i>, <i>heavy act</i>, <i>heavy task</i>, <i>heavy day</i>, <i>heavy
hour</i>, <i>heavy gait</i>, <i>heavy leave</i>, <i>heavy message</i>, <i>heavy
summons</i>. Explain what each means.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Similarly there are <i>light gifts</i>, <i>light behavior</i>, <i>light
heart</i>, <i>light loss</i>, <i>light of foot</i>, <i>light wings</i>, <i>light foam</i>.
Another drudge of a word, <i>thick</i>, learns new and
pleasanter tasks of the great poet. <i>Thick sight</i>,
<i>thick perils</i>, <i>thick in their thoughts</i>, <i>thick sighs</i>, <i>thick
slumber</i>. Explain each of these phrases. Opposed
to <i>thick</i> is <i>thin</i>: <i>thin air</i>, <i>thin drink</i>, <i>thin and slender
pittance</i>. These are the things that Shakespeare
calls <i>high</i>: <i>high deeds</i>, <i>high descent</i>, <i>high desert</i>, <i>high
designs</i>, <i>high disgrace</i>, <i>high exploits</i>, <i>high feats</i>, <i>high
good trim</i>, <i>high heaven</i>, <i>high hope</i>, <i>high perfection</i>,
<i>high resolve</i>, <i>high reward</i>. One more word, <i>golden</i>.
Lesser poets would apply it to physical objects.
Shakespeare, too, speaks of the sun “Kissing with
golden face the meadows green,” and of “This majestical
roof fretted with golden fire.” But elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
he manages to apply the adjective to things
that cannot so directly be called golden. Thus:
“A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.”
“... wear a golden sorrow.” “Golden lads and
girls all must, As chimney sweepers, come to dust.”
“Nestor’s golden words.” Explain each of these
uses.</p>

<p>Of course many of these figurative expressions
are too poetical by far for the prose of high school
students. Nevertheless, many others would be appropriate
in the manuscript of any person,—for
instance, <i>high designs</i>, <i>high deeds</i>, <i>high exploits</i>, <i>high
resolve</i>. Such uses as these can be cultivated to
the enrichment of the vocabulary.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b><a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>—Each of the following adjectives
applies primarily to physical objects, that
can be seen, or heard, or touched, or tasted. But
each is often raised to a higher use, being made to
name some quality of character, or some other
abstract idea. Take the adjectives one by one,
and under each write in class as many abstract
words as you think can properly be modified by
the given adjective. Thus the adjective <i>fine</i>, which
is used of such physical objects as <i>sand</i>, <i>cloth</i>, <i>particles</i>,
may also apply to <i>courage</i>, <i>sense of honor</i>,
<i>presence</i>, <i>phrases</i>, <i>words</i>, <i>deeds</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Value of Careful Reading.</b>—A writer must
perhaps be as dependent on books for his vocabulary
as on any other one source. Yet it is possible
to read a great deal without absorbing many new
expressions. To gain new words and new ideas,
the student must compel himself to read slowly.
Impatient to hurry on and learn how the tale or
poem ends, many a youth is accustomed to read so
rapidly as to miss the best part of what the author
is trying to say. Thoughts cannot be read so
rapidly as words. To get at the thoughts and
really to retain the valuable expressions, the student
must scrutinize and ponder as he reads. Each
word must be thoroughly understood; its exact
value in the given sentence must be grasped. It
will not do to draft off a long list of new expressions
into the note-book, and then investigate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
meaning of each after the connection in which each
was used has been forgotten. Usually the best
way is to look up the meaning when the word is
come upon. This is always the best way when a
passage is being read with a view to increasing
one’s vocabulary. When a tale or poem or essay is
being read for its general theme, or for its literary
construction, it is often desirable to underline each
new word, leaving the meaning to be investigated
a little later. In finding the value of the word in
its sentence, the student is often little aided by
the dictionary. Imagination and reasoning must
sometimes be called into play before the definition
can be made to apply. The dictionary—particularly
the abridged dictionary—is not a magic
book, ready to explain every delicate shading
that a great author gives a word in a particular
connection.</p>

<p>In reading silently it is due the author to read
with as much expression as if one were pronouncing
the words aloud. One should mentally give every
word and phrase its proper accent, should feel the
value of every punctuation mark. The force of
such a passage as the following, from Carlyle, will
be lost unless the reader puts the emphasis in
exactly the right places.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Manhood begins when we have in any way made truce
with Necessity; begins, at all events, when we have surrendered
to Necessity, as the most part only do; but begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
joyfully and hopefully only when we have reconciled ourselves
to Necessity; and thus, in reality, triumphed over it,
and felt that in Necessity we are free.</p>

</div>

<p>Literature is full of words descriptive of things
that all have seen or heard. We render a service
to the memory if in reading we linger long
enough to call up the colors, shapes, motions,
sounds, that are suggested by the text. Some persons
recall sights more easily than sounds, some
recall sounds more easily than sights; some can
remember motions more easily than either colors,
shapes, or sounds. It is therefore good training
for the word-memory if we endeavor to recall all
kinds of sense impressions. Read the following
passage slowly, imagining the sights, motions, and
sensations of touch, that are suggested.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A long way down that limpid water, chill and bright as
an iceberg, went my little self that day on man’s choice
errand—destruction. All the young fish seemed to know
that I was one who had taken out God’s certificate, and
meant to have the value of it; every one of them was aware
that we desolate more than replenish the earth. For a cow
might come and look into the water, and put her yellow lips
down; a kingfisher, like a blue arrow, might shoot through
the dark alleys over the channel, or sit on a dipping withy-bough
with his beak sunk into his breast-feathers; even an
otter might float down stream, likening himself to a log of
wood, with his flat head flush with the water-top, and his
oily eyes peering quietly; and yet no panic would seize other
life, as it does when a sample of man comes.—<span class="smcap">R. D. Blackmore</span>,

<p>Imagine as vividly as possible each sound and
other physical sensation suggested by the following
selection, from the book just quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The volumes of the mist came rolling at me (like great
logs of wood, pillowed out with sleepiness), and between
them there was nothing more than waiting for the next one.
Then everything went out of sight, and glad was I of the
stone behind me, and view of mine own shoes. Then a
distant noise went by me, as of many horses galloping, and
in my fright I set my gun and said, “God send something
to shoot at.” Yet nothing came, and my gun fell back,
without my will to lower it.</p>

<p>But presently, while I was thinking “What a fool I
am!” arose as if from below my feet, so that the great
stone trembled, that long lamenting, lonesome sound, as of
an evil spirit not knowing what to do with it. For the
moment I stood like a root, without either hand or foot to
help me, and the hair of my head began to crawl, lifting
my hat, as a snail lifts his house, and my heart like a shuttle
went to and fro. But finding no harm to come of it, neither
visible form approaching, I wiped my forehead and hoped
for the best, and resolved to run every step of the way till
I drew our own latch behind me.</p>

<p>Yet here again I was disappointed, for no sooner was I
come to the cross-ways by the black pool in the hole, but
I heard through the patter of my own feet a rough low
sound very close in the fog, as of a hobbled sheep a-coughing.
I listened, and feared, and yet listened again, though I
wanted not to hear it. For being in haste of the homeward
road, and all my heart having heels to it, loath I was to
stop in the dusk for the sake of an aged wether. Yet partly
my love of all animals, and partly my fear of the farmer’s
disgrace, compelled me to go to the succor, and the noise
was coming nearer. A dry, short, wheezing sound it was,
barred with coughs and want of breath; but thus I made
the meaning of it:—</p>

<p>The value of minute and thoughtful reading has
been set forth by John Ruskin, in his <i>Sesame and

tone which Ruskin so often uses. The oft-quoted
passage in which he illustrates his idea of
how a poem should be read, is given below. The

as Ruskin would have him, will find
his command of words rapidly increasing, and his

</div>

<p>Let us think over this passage, and examine its words.</p>

<p>First, is it not singular to find Milton assigning to St.
Peter, not only his full episcopal function, but the very
types of it which Protestants usually refuse most passionately?
His “mitred” locks! Milton was no Bishop-lover;
how comes St. Peter to be “mitred”? “Two massy keys
he bore.” Is this, then, the power of the keys claimed by
the bishops of Rome, and is it acknowledged here by Milton
only in a poetical license, for the sake of its picturesqueness,
that he may get the gleam of the golden keys to help his
effect? Do not think it. Great men do not play stage
tricks with doctrines of life and death: only little men do
that. Milton means what he says; and means it with his
might too—is going to put the whole strength of his spirit
presently into the saying of it. For though not a lover of
false bishops, he <i>was</i> a lover of true ones; and the Lake-pilot
is here, in his thoughts, the type and head of true
episcopal power. For Milton reads that text, “I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven” quite honestly.
Puritan though he be, he would not blot it out of the book
because there have been bad bishops; nay, in order to
understand him, we must understand that verse first; it
will not do to eye it askance, or whisper it under our breath,
as if it were a weapon of an adverse sect. It is a solemn,
universal assertion, deeply to be kept in mind by all sects.
But perhaps we shall be better able to reason on it if we go
on a little farther, and come back to it. For clearly, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
marked insistence on the power of the true episcopate is
to make us feel more weightily what is to be charged against
the false claimants of episcopate; or generally, against false
claimants of power and rank in the body of the clergy; they
who, “for their bellies’ sake, creep, and intrude, and climb
into the fold.”</p>

<p>Do not think Milton uses those three words to fill up his
verse, as a loose writer would. He needs all the three;
specially those three, and no more than those—“creep,”
and “intrude,” and “climb”; no other words would or
could serve the turn, and no more could be added. For
they exhaustively comprehend the three classes, correspondent
to the three characters, of men who dishonestly seek
ecclesiastical power. First, those who “creep” into the
fold, who do not care for office, nor name, but for secret
influence, and do all things occultly and cunningly, consenting
to any servility of office or conduct, so only that they
may intimately discern, and unawares direct, the minds of
men. Then those who “intrude” (thrust, that is) themselves
into the fold, who by natural insolence of heart and
stout eloquence of tongue and fearlessly perseverant self-assertion
obtain hearing and authority with the common
crowd. Lastly, those who “climb,” who, by labor and
learning both stout and sound, but selfishly exerted in the
cause of their own ambition, gain high dignities and authorities,
and become “lords over the heritage,” though
not “ensamples to the flock.”</p>

<p>Now go on:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Of other care they little reckoning make</div>
<div class="verse">Than how to scramble at the shearers’ feast.</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Blind mouths</i>—”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I pause again, for this is a strange expression,—a broken
metaphor, one might think, careless and unscholarly.</p>

<p>Not so; its very audacity and pithiness are intended to
make us look close at the phrase and remember it. Those
two monosyllables express the precisely accurate contraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of right character, in the two great offices of the Church—those
of bishop and pastor.</p>

<p>A Bishop means a person who sees.</p>

<p>A Pastor means one who feeds.</p>

<p>The most unbishoply character a man can have is therefore
to be Blind.</p>

<p>The most unpastoral is, instead of feeding, to want to be
fed,—to be a Mouth.</p>

<p>Take the two reverses together, and you have “blind
mouths.” We may advisably follow out this idea a little.
Nearly all the evils in the Church have arisen from bishops
desiring <i>power</i> more than <i>light</i>. They want authority, not
outlook. Whereas their real office is not to rule; though
it may be vigorously to exhort and rebuke; it is the king’s
office to rule; the bishop’s office is to <i>oversee</i> the flock; to
number it, sheep by sheep; to be ready always to give full
account of it. Now it is clear he cannot give account of
the souls, if he has not so much as numbered the bodies
of his flock. The first thing, therefore, that a bishop has
to do is at least to put himself in a position in which, at any
moment, he can obtain the history from childhood of every
living soul in his diocese, and of its present state. Down
in that back street, Bill, and Nancy, knocking each other’s
teeth out!—Does the bishop know all about it? Has he his
eye upon them? Has he <i>had</i> his eye upon them? Can he
circumstantially explain to us how Bill got into the habit of
beating Nancy about the head? If he cannot, he is no
bishop, though he had a mitre as high as Salisbury steeple.
He is no bishop,—he has sought to be at the helm instead
of the masthead; he has no sight of things. “Nay,” you
say, “it is not his duty to look after Bill in the back street.”
What! the fat sheep that have full fleeces,—you think it
is only those he should look after, while (go back to your
Milton) “the hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, besides
what the grim wolf, with privy paw” (bishops knowing
nothing about it) “daily devours apace, and nothing said”?</p>

<p>“But that’s not our idea of a bishop.” Perhaps not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
but it was St. Paul’s, and it was Milton’s. They may be
right, or we may be; but we must not think we are reading
either one or the other by putting our meaning into their words.</p>

<p>[Ruskin goes on to discuss other expressions
with the same minuteness.]</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Contributions from Other Studies.</b>—In acquiring
any new science or art one learns many new terms,
some of which are not too technical for use in themes.
For that matter, every exercise written in any subject
cannot help being to some extent an exercise in
English. The vocabulary book should receive contributions
from every line of the student’s work.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Translation.</b>—There is no better means of making
the memory yield up the words which it has
formerly caught, than translation. Professor A. S.
Hill quotes the reported words of Rufus Choate:
“Translation should be pursued to bring to mind
and to employ all the words you already own, and
to tax and torment invention and discovery and the
very deepest memory for additional, rich, and admirably
expressive words.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Every lesson in translating
is a lesson in self-expression. Professor
Carpenter testifies<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that the Latin-trained boys
entering scientific schools are remarkably superior
in power of expression to those not so trained; and
his testimony is confirmed by the experience of
many other teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Memorizing of Literature.</b>—To the habit of memorizing,
many a person is indebted not merely for
high thoughts that cheer hours of solitude and that
stimulate his own thinking, but for command of
words. The degree to which the language of
modern writers is derived from a few great authors
is startling. Shakespeare’s phrases are a part
of the tissue of every man’s speech to-day. Such
writers as Charles Lamb bear Shakespeare’s mark
on every page. The language of the King James
version of the Bible is echoed in modern English
prose and poetry. It formed styles so unlike as
those of Bunyan, Ruskin, and Abraham Lincoln.
Most teachers would declare that a habit of learning
Scripture by heart is of incalculable value to a
student’s English. In the Authorized Version, and
to almost as great an extent in the Revised Version,
the Anglo-Saxon element and the Latin are both
present in marvellous effectiveness.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that whatever help one’s writing is
to receive from memorizing will come naturally
through one’s study of literature. But so many
of the strongest words in the language, particularly
the Saxon words, have been treasured up in
the homely sayings of the people, that I have ventured
to suggest a list of proverbs for memorizing.
Just how many of these it may be advisable for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
given pupil to retain in mind is a matter to be
decided by the instructor. Certainly each student
will do well to learn a score of those that seem to
him best worth remembering. Each saying preserves
some fine word in some natural context, a
fact that will make the word far easier to recall
than it would be if learned as an isolated term.
Not more than ten or fifteen minutes a day ought
to be given to the memorizing.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Synonyms.</b>—A synonym is a word that means
the same or nearly the same thing as some other
word. Our language, from its composite nature,
is peculiarly rich in synonyms. In hundreds of
cases English has absorbed both the Saxon and
the French or Latin word for a given idea.
Nearly always, in such cases, one of the words
has acquired a distinctly different shade of meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from the other. Indeed, one of the words
is sure to acquire a slightly different <i>value</i>, whether
from its associations or its sound. While it may
roughly be said that there are words which mean
the same thing, yet for the really careful writer
there are no synonyms.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Synonyms for Adjectives of Praise.</b>—In another
sense there are many people who seem to have
no synonyms. You have doubtless known persons
who lacked all means of differentiating praise,—persons
who applied the same adjective to everything,
from a pin to the solar system. There are
the people who find everything either <i>nice</i> or <i>not
nice</i>; the people who eat <i>elegant soups</i> and sigh
at <i>elegant sunsets</i>; the people who have <i>jolly times</i>,
<i>jolly canes</i>, <i>jolly excuses</i>. To the <i>nice</i> group, the
<i>elegant</i> group, and the <i>jolly</i> group, may be added
the <i>lovely</i> group, and many others.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Apply several proper adjectives
of praise to each of the following: soup, sunset,
poodle, lady, moon, time (<i>e.g.</i> meaning an excursion),
silk, opera, book-binding, gown, face, mountain,
box of sweets, ice-cream, disposition, story,
manner, soul, fan, perfume, roses, piano-playing,
sermon, editorial or leader, critique.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>A Danger.</b>—The study of synonyms cultivates
discrimination. But as a study for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
widening the active vocabulary it must be judiciously
limited. If one turns to a book of synonyms,
one finds on many a page some score of
words meaning nearly the same thing. Many of
these words are unusual, out-of-the-way expressions,
to use which would make a man sound like a prig.
Simplicity is a cardinal virtue in writing. If this
fact is kept in mind, and the student does not affect
too elaborate and bookish words, the study of
synonyms will be of the utmost service to him.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>A Method of Study.</b>—Below are listed a good
many groups of synonyms. They are to be studied
now and to be used hereafter for reference in the
work of writing. Each group contains only a few
of the words that might demand a place if the question
were merely one of meaning. The words here
chosen are such as may properly appear in the work
of any high school student, <i>if there is need of them
to express the student’s meaning</i>.</p>

<p>Even in these groups some words are simpler,
and therefore in general more desirable. <i>The class
should first examine the entire list, underlining carefully
the simpler words in each group. These, simpler
words are regularly to be preferred when their meaning
is exact enough for the idea in mind.</i> The
others are to be mastered for the sake of the distinctions
they express, and for their occasional usefulness
as a means of avoiding repetitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The underlining finished, the groups may further
be studied with a view to discriminating the various
terms. Fifteen minutes a day is enough to devote
to this work, and in some cases it may be best to
examine minutely only a part of the list, leaving
the rest to be used for reference.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—It will be found useful to
spend five minutes a day in copying off several
times each unfamiliar word. Unless the hand is
accustomed to tracing the word, the mind will not
be likely to demand this act of the hand in the
moment of composition.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Each student may be asked to
pronounce every word that he has not been in the
habit of using orally. Since the same term is
likely to have been neglected by many of the class,
a considerable amount of ear-training will be received
by all.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—One of the best, because most
natural, ways of studying synonyms, is to examine
a page of good prose with a view to seeing whether
synonyms could have been used as effectively as
the actual words in the text. Choose such a page,
underline the important words, and examine the
list to find the group to which each belongs. Then
substitute for the word in the text the other words
of the group, and see whether the author’s choice
was wise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Each group should be taken up
in turn and discussed by the class after the meanings
of unfamiliar words have been looked up in
the dictionary. The force of each word <i>as a synonym
of the others in its group</i> should be brought out
by illustrative sentences. The differences in meaning
should be talked about until they are thoroughly
understood. Fernald’s <i>Synonyms, Antonyms, and
Prepositions</i>, and Smith’s <i>Synonyms Discriminated</i>,
are good books of reference if any doubtful question
arises.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Study an assigned number
of groups, and pick out the word which seems to
have the most general meaning, the word which,
more than any other, includes the remaining members
of the group. Thus, in the series <i>Actual</i>, <i>authentic</i>,
<i>genuine</i>, <i>real</i>, the last is the most general
term. Real applies to a larger number of things
than any of its synonyms.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—Study an assigned number of
groups, and say what idea the members of each
have in common, and, if possible, what additional
idea each member has. Thus, <i>Adept</i>, <i>adroit</i>, <i>deft</i>,
<i>dexterous</i>, <i>handy</i>, <i>skilful</i>, each have the idea <i>skilful</i>.
<i>Adept</i> means skilful in some art or occupation.
<i>Adroit</i> means skilful with the hand, or with the
mind,—<i>i.e.</i> tactful. <i>Deft</i>, <i>dexterous</i> usually mean
skilful with the hand; <i>deft</i> refers to movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the fingers, <i>dexterous</i> to quick motions, as of the
hand. <i>Handy</i> means skilful at manual exercises.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—One member of each group
should be pronounced, and the student asked to
give from memory the other members.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral or Written Exercise.</b>—Only one part of
speech is represented in each group. The student
should be asked to give corresponding parts of
speech. Thus, the adjective series <i>Actual</i>, <i>authentic</i>,
<i>genuine</i>, <i>real</i>, yields the adverbs <i>actually</i>, <i>authentically</i>,
<i>genuinely</i>, <i>really</i>, and the nouns <i>actuality</i>,
<i>authenticity</i>, <i>genuineness</i>, <i>reality</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral or Written Exercise.</b>—In the following,
vary the overworked words as much as possible.
Permit repetition only when it is necessary for
clearness.</p>

<p>1. I think the committee selected to select theme
topics for the class to write upon, should be careful
not to select too many topics on one subject,
since the nature of one student differs from that of
another. I think that the few who are not satisfied
with the topics the committee have selected, should
be required to select and hand in a list of topics on
which they would like to write.</p>

<p>2. There are two distinct stories running through
the Merchant of Venice: the story of the pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
flesh and the story of the caskets. These stories
run parallel to each other through the play, as far
as the third act, where the story of the caskets is
ended by the lucky choice of Bassanio. But from
here a new story, the story of the rings, commences,
and continues through the rest of the
play, crossing the story of the pound of flesh and
finally taking the place of this story.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Future Revision.</b>—Henceforth one distinct object
for which every theme should be revised is
<i>variety of words</i>. It soon becomes a keen satisfaction
to read one’s own work aloud to detect overworked
expressions. In the pursuit of variety, the
scholar not merely grows sensitive to the ugly
recurrence of the same sound; he grows bold to
repeat words if the repetition is demanded for
clearness or force. Some things seem to have but
one name in English; more’s the pity; but we
must make the best of the case.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">RIGHT NUMBER AND SKILFUL CHOICE OF WORDS</span></h2>

<p>Let it be supposed that a person has learned to
plan a composition logically and to write with
grammatical correctness; that further he has acquired
a noble unrest which keeps him searching
for new words and fine distinctions; what should
be his next care?</p>

<p>After the power of thinking coherently, the
ability most important to a writer is that of picking
out from the wide world of words the one
expression that mates his unworded idea. His
choice of words—<i>i.e.</i> his <i>diction</i>—must meet
three requirements. If it is to be <i>clear</i>, it must
mean the same to the reader’s intellect that it does
to the writer’s. If it is to <i>forcible</i>, it must move
the reader’s feelings as it moved the writer’s.
Furthermore, if it is to be <i>beautiful</i>, it must please
a reader who has good taste.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Clearness.</b>—Clearness, the intellectual quality of
style, has already been referred to (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>), for it is
the quality aimed at in making sentences coherent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
That the idea should be made unmistakably clear
is the first requisite of good writing. The thinking
must be clear; the division of the theme into
paragraphs, and of paragraphs into sentences must
be clear; and the words must be clear. We have
presently to ask what effect number and choice of
words have upon clearness.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Force.</b>—Force is the emotional quality of style.
It may occur in a very moderate degree, just
enough to <i>interest</i> the reader slightly, or it may be
present to such an extent as to move the deepest
springs of feeling. It is hard to give suggestions
for securing force, because language is better
adapted to communicating ideas than emotions.
We find that language furnishes very few names
for feelings. Furthermore, these names, even such
as <i>love</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>anger</i>, do not in themselves move us.
What a marvellous variety of emotion each of us
feels in a day! how many delicate tints of pleasure!
how many shades of regret or fear, of painful
memory or suggestion! The psychologists tell us
that we do no act which does not bring with it
some touch of pleasure or of pain. And yet most
of these shades and tints and touches of feeling
neither have names nor can be communicated by
words. Nevertheless, though language cannot directly
convey feeling, it can sometimes suggest
feeling. If your reader has experienced a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
emotion, some word of yours may recall that to his
mind. One secret of being forcible lies in choosing
theme subjects that interest the reader; subjects
that set up a train of feeling and memory in
his mind. Other secrets are, to choose <i>suggestive</i>
words and figures of speech, and to refrain from
wearing out interest by too many words. We shall
presently inquire, what words and figures are most
suggestive.</p>

<p>Something may be done to secure force by so
arranging words as to attract the reader’s attention.
It will be noted that emphasis (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>) and
climax (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>) are means of force.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Beauty.</b>—Beauty is the quality of style which
satisfies what is called, for lack of a better word,
the æsthetic sense; this is little else but saying,
beauty of style satisfies the sense for beauty. One
element of beauty is <i>simplicity</i>, a quality closely
allied to clearness, yet not the same. <i>Euphony</i>, or
absence of ugly sounds, is another element of
beauty. <i>Variety</i> is another element of beauty. It
is clear that the last exercise in Chapter X is as
much an exercise in beauty as in vocabulary. In
the present chapter we shall have space to consider
only one element of beauty,—that of simplicity.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Prolixity.</b>—If a writer descends into tedious details,
or if he repeats the same idea over and over
in slightly different words, without developing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
adding to the thought, he is said to be prolix.
Prolixity offends chiefly against force, for it kills
interest. This fault may affect merely a single
sentence or paragraph, or it may infest a whole
composition. It does not much beset the writer
who plans his work ahead. It can be corrected
only by rewriting.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.—</b>The following prolix passage
should be rewritten, only the essential thoughts
being kept. Any mistakes and crudities of style
should be corrected.</p>

<p>“My friend the doctor was a collector of ancient
coins and was always roaming about the ruins of
old cities in search of coins. He would wander
around and pick up valuable relics like the Venus
he wore in his seal ring. He was always finding
something worth keeping. He would pick up a
precious bit of antiquity and put it in his pocket,
and so he always carried with him a regular collection
of relics. One afternoon he was out among
the mountains picking up relics and not looking
up to see whether any one was near. When he
looked around he saw five or perhaps six rough
fellows who were standing there behind him. He
fell to quivering with fright and stood trembling
and shaking, but managed to greet them. After
he had greeted the five or six men they all walked
along down the road until they came to an inn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
was there on the mountain-side. It was an inn and
not a cave there in the mountains, as was incorrectly
said by one member of the class.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Surplusage.-</b>-Surplusage consists of words that
can be excised without hurting the sense of the
passage. In tyros it is perhaps less of a fault than
the opposite one of <i>deficiency</i>,—the absence of
needed words; for fulness of expression is essential
to clearness, and surplusage often results from
the desire to be clear. Verbosity, however, dulls
the edge of the keenest thought. Like prolixity, it
weakens. Just as many a prolix speaker could
make a brilliant oration if he knew when to stop,
so many a wordy writer could make an effective
sentence if he knew what to prune away. As Mr.
Lowell would say:<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Thoughts are never draped in
long skirts like babies, if they are strong enough to
go alone.</p>

<p>The redundant use of the following common
words should be avoided:—</p>

<p>1. <i>From</i>, in the phrases <i>from thence</i>, <i>from whence</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Of</i>, especially in the expressions <i>off of</i>, <i>remember
of</i>, <i>treat of</i>. “Keep off [not <i>off of</i>] the grass.”
“This book treats [better than <i>treats of</i>] chemistry.”</p>

<p>3. <i>On</i>, with the words <i>the next morning</i>. “He
was rebellious on the seventh of July, but the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
morning [not <i>on the next morning</i>] he reappeared
in a more submissive frame of mind.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Prune away every word that
can be spared; note the increase in force. Slight
changes may be made in the wording.</p>

<p>1. All of the ships were lost; no kind of a one
was saved.</p>

<p>2. I know from my own personal knowledge
that a man who stands upright in his own manhood,
honest and conscious of the rectitude of his
purposes, is safe against calumny and slander.</p>

<p>3. I don’t think it a good precedent to set in
this house for any man to vote for a bill in which
he has a personal interest, and I don’t remember of
ever having done so of myself. I shall, therefore,
for this reason, refrain from voting, but I want to
say a word on this bill, and I want to talk to the
democrats.</p>

<p>4. Real-estate dealer is knocked down by an
accident and is run over by a cab.</p>

<p>5. Commencing on Monday, March 29, supported
by the New York Garrick Theatre Stock Company,
Mr. Mansfield will commence an engagement of
two weeks at the Grand Opera House.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written or Oral Exercise.</b>—In the following
sentences some of the underscored expressions
should be expressed more briefly by changing
clauses to phrases or phrases to single words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Thus: <i>men who deserved and won renown</i> may
shorten to <i>men of deserved renown</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Men who deserved and won renown</i>, and <i>women
who were peerless</i>, have lived upon what we should
now call the coarsest fare, and paced the rushes
<i>which were strewn</i> in their rooms with as high, or as
contented thoughts, as their <i>descendants, persons
who are fed better and clothed better than they</i>, can
boast of.</p>

<p>2. If children <i>are able</i> to make us wiser, <i>it is
sure that they can also</i> make us better. There is no
one <i>who is more to be envied</i> than a good-natured
man <i>when he is watching how children’s minds perform
their workings, or when he is overlooking the
play they engage in</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Deficiency of Words.</b>—It was said in a former
paragraph that in young writers surplusage is perhaps
less of a fault than is the lack of needed
words. Verbosity robs a theme of force; deficiency
robs it of force and clearness. It is human nature
to try to say a thing more briefly than is possible.
Forgetting that pitch, stress, and gesture do much
to make spoken words intelligible, the easy-going
writer does not tax himself to attain full and lucid
expression. He forgets that a piece of writing
may be so condensed as to be dense.</p>

<p>Ambiguity often springs from the omission of
merely a word or two. Reading such a phrase as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
“the secretary and treasurer,” we are vexed with
doubt whether one person is meant, or two; the
omission of the article seems to imply that the two
offices are vested in a single officer. The lack of a
few words may turn force into weakness. A German
newspaper thus burlesques the compression to
which editors sometimes feel impelled: “Ottokar
took a small brandy, then his hat, his departure,
besides no notice of his pursuers, meantime a
revolver out of his pocket, and lastly his own life.”</p>

<p>The following common words should not be
omitted:—</p>

<p>1. The main part of an infinitive at the end of a
sentence. <i>Wrong</i>: “He did what he wished to.”
<i>Right</i>: “He did what he wished to do.”</p>

<p>2. The adverb <i>much</i> before certain adjectives.
<i>Wrong</i>: “He was very pleased to comply.” <i>Right</i>:
“He was very much pleased to comply.”</p>

<p>3. (<i>a</i>) The preposition <i>at</i> with home. <i>Wrong</i>:
“I stayed home and slept home.” <i>Right</i>: “I
stayed at home and slept at home.” (<i>b</i>) The
preposition <i>on</i> with days of the month. <i>Wrong</i>:
“The seventh of July he rebelled.” <i>Right</i>: “On
the seventh of July he rebelled.” Compare page
231. 3.</p>

<p>4. A demonstrative used for clearness. <i>Wrong</i>:
“He chose between the lot of the rich and of the
poor.” <i>Right</i>: “He chose between the lot of the
rich and that of the poor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The conjunction <i>that</i> when needed for clearness.
<i>Wrong</i>: “I wish such a beefsteak as that
one over there may never be served on this table.”
What is the ambiguity here, at the beginning?</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Indicate how by the addition of
words each sentence may be corrected:—</p>

<p>1. Altogether it was a day like unto which the
memory of the oldest inhabitant could not recall.</p>

<p>2. He received his early education at Brownsville
and Whitesville academy, remaining about a
year at each place.</p>

<p>3. There was a minister who, being informed by
the church officials that they had raised his salary
$100, declined to accept it.</p>

<p>4. The following great reductions indicate the
heavy losses we are taking closing out the balance
of our stock.</p>

<p>5. This mutual esteem was shown by their cordial
welcome of the guests as well as the uniform
courtesy shown by the latter.</p>

<p>6. Poor Evelina was obliged to choose between
a blue and green dress.</p>

<p>7. Streaks of lightning and claps of thunder
rattled through the narrow streets of Paris.</p>

<p>8. I am an historical painter by profession, and
living for some time at a villa near Rome.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Specific Words.</b>—Suppose it were desired to
make clear to a friend how the sunset looked—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
difficult task. One would hardly succeed if one
had no better words to offer than the general
terms <i>clouds</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>lovely</i>, <i>bright</i>. The friend,
if he cared to know, would insist on specific
words: What kind of beauty? was it quiet beauty,
or awful beauty, or picturesque beauty? What
kind of brightness? was it redness? If so, was
the sky blood-red, or merely pink? What kind of
clouds?—great masses of storm cloud, or high
frozen clouds, or mottled “mackerel” clouds? To
be clear, then, words must be specific enough to
give the idea intended. Just how specific they
should be depends on the audience. They must
be familiar to the hearer or reader, if they are to
be understood without explanation. All audiences
would understand the general term <i>tool</i>; all would
understand the genus name <i>saw</i>, which specifies a
kind of tool. But many would not understand the
species name <i>rip-saw</i>; for to most people <i>rip-saw</i>
is unfortunately a technical term. In choosing
specific words the line should therefore be drawn
between common terms and technical terms, the
latter not to be employed without explanation,
except in addressing special audiences.</p>

<p>Specific words are usually as forcible as they are
clear. Most people’s feelings are roused by the
thought of a particular object, not of a class name.
<i>Flower</i> is a class name; it does not move one.
<i>Clover</i> is a specific name; it calls back the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
farm, the old friends, the old joys and sorrows.
No word will really interest the reader unless he
has previously used it or heard it in association
with his feelings. Take the word <i>contusion</i>; it
means something forcible to a doctor, but not to a
boy, for the latter never used it. But say <i>bruise</i>—which
means exactly the same thing. That’s forcible.
It feelingly reminds us of the hour in which
that dead branch broke and delivered us over to
the law of gravitation.</p>

<p>Pick out from these words those that are in
themselves forcible to most people: paternal solicitude,
fatherly care; home, domicile; altruism,
unselfishness. You see at once that certain of
these words get their force from the long associations
of childhood. In childhood we use the
simpler words of the language, those that are
derived from the Anglo-Saxon mother-tongue.
Anglo-Saxon words, therefore, are usually forcible.

</ul>

<p class="tb"><b>General Words.</b>—We found that most specific
words are of Anglo-Saxon origin. Most general
words are of Latin origin. Both these statements
are only roughly true, of course; but the distinction
is worth making. The language of science is
mostly of Latin origin, because it consists so largely
of class names. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers had
fewer class names, for they had not progressed far
enough to care to classify everything. When, later,
the English came to study history, and philosophy,
and science, they had either to invent new Anglo-Saxon
words for class names, or else use Latin
words. They chose the latter course. Consequently
we have such Latin class names as <i>animal</i>,
and such individual names as <i>cat</i>, <i>dog</i>, <i>horse</i>, <i>pig</i>.
We speak of <i>white</i>, <i>blue</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>red</i>; but when we
want a class name for these, we say <i>color</i>, a Latin
word. From all this it may be seen that any great
number of general words gives a scientific, abstract
tone to writing. General words are absolutely
necessary for the exact purposes of science and
philosophy. They are adapted, as Professor Carpenter
puts it, to “precise and elaborate distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of thought.” They do not give a clear mental
image; that is, you cannot <i>see</i> beauty, or smallness,
or animal, or color—you can see only a beautiful
object, a small object, a particular animal, a particular
color. But, still, general words mean exactly
what they say. <i>Animal</i> means exactly this: a
summing up of all the qualities that are common
to all individual animals. All the things called
animal have in common powers of sensation and
voluntary movement. When such a distinction is
wanted, it is wanted badly, as we say. There is
no better mark of literary mastery than knowing
just when to use a general word, just when a specific
one. Examine a few pages from Robert Louis
Stevenson, to see with what exquisite fitness words
of Latin origin may be used in the midst of Anglo-Saxon
words when the appeal turns from the feelings
to the intellect.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why a writer may not
wish to be too specific. In the sentence, “I picked
up my traps and left,” the colloquialism <i>traps</i>
answers every essential purpose. The reader does
not care to have tooth-brush and books and papers
all specified. People are not to be blamed for referring
vaguely to <i>death</i> as a <i>passing away</i>, for the
specific word is harsh at best. Such expressions
as <i>pass away</i> are called <i>euphemisms</i>. Many euphemisms
are legitimate; but whether a given one
should be employed is a question of taste, a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of beauty. It seems a beautiful expression
when Keats says, “to cease upon the midnight
with no pain,” instead of, “to die painlessly at
twelve o’clock;” but it is a mark of false modesty
and bad taste to insist on saying <i>rose</i> for <i>got up</i>,
<i>retire</i> for <i>go to bed</i>, <i>lower limbs</i> for <i>legs</i>.</p>

<p>Again, one should not always hesitate to set
down an idea because one has not the sharpest,
clearest possible notion of it. Vague ideas are
sometimes valuable ones. They should receive
earnest thought that they may take definite shape.
But if they seem to defy definite form, they certainly
should not be thrown away merely for that.
Catching one’s exact idea is often as difficult as
catching a trout. But a glimpse of the fine fish
that gets away is worth something,—there are
few of us who can resist the temptation to tell
about it when we get home. Speaking of the
mind, Emerson says, “It is wholesome to angle in
those profound pools, though one be rewarded with
nothing more than the leap of a fish that flashes
his freckled side in the sun and as suddenly absconds
in the dark and dreamy waters again.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
In Wordsworth’s poem, The Solitary Reaper, we
hear of a song about <i>old, unhappy, far-off things</i>.
That was exactly Wordsworth’s own vague notion,
and down he set it—in words that make it clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
(so to speak) that his idea was sweet and vague.
Ruskin, describing the façade of St. Mark’s in
Venice, tries to give a sense of the bewildering
multiplicity of beautiful things on that wonderful
front by saying, <i>a confusion of delight</i>. If he had
used more definite words we should have missed
the effect.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—In the following passage, choose

Each pair contains one general and one specific
term; choose the term which gives greater force or

<p>1. And therefore, first of all, I tell you earnestly
and authoritatively (I <i>know</i> I am right in this) you
must get into the [way, habit] of looking [rightly,
intensely] at words, and [telling, assuring] yourself
of their meaning, syllable by syllable—nay, letter
by letter. For ... you might read all the books
in [a great library, the British Museum] (if you
could live long enough) and remain an utterly “illiterate,”
uneducated person; but if you read [some
part, ten pages] of [a good, an instructive] book,
letter by letter—that is to say, with real [care,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
accuracy]—you are forevermore in some [way,
measure] an educated [man, person]. The entire
difference between education and non-education (as
regards the merely [mental, intellectual] part of
it) consists in this [exactitude, accuracy]. A well-educated
gentleman may not [read, know] many
languages, may not be able to speak any but his
own, may have read very few books. But whatever
language he knows, he knows [well, precisely];
whatever word he [says, pronounces] he
[says, pronounces] rightly. Above all, he is learned
in the <i>peerage</i> of words, knows the words of [true,
veritable] descent, and [old, ancient] blood, at a
glance, from the words of [new, modern] <i>canaille</i>,
remembers all their ancestry, their intermarriages,
distant relationships, and the extent to which they
were admitted, and offices they held, among the
national <i>noblesse</i> of words at any time and in any
[place, country]. But an uneducated person may
know, by [heart, memory], many languages, and
[use, talk] them all, and yet truly [know, apprehend]
not a word of any—not a word even of his
own. An ordinarily [clever, good] and sensible
seaman will be able to make his way ashore at
most [ports, places], yet he has only to speak [a
little, a sentence] of [Spanish or French, any language]
to be [known, recognized] for an illiterate
person; so also the accent, or turn of expression of
a single sentence, will at once mark a scholar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
And this is so [well, strongly] felt, so [conclusively,
well] admitted, by educated persons, that a
false accent or a [bad, mistaken] syllable is enough
in the parliament of any civilized nation, to [assign,
send] man to a certain degree of [lower, inferior]
standing forever.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Simple Words.</b>—Several years ago a gentleman<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
secured from a large number of successful authors
brief pieces of advice to young writers. In one
particular there was an extraordinary unanimity
among these authors. Nearly all agreed that a
young writer should try to express himself simply.
They agreed on other matters too,—for example,
on the need of clear thinking and an inclination to
take much pains in expression. But it was noticeable
that even writers whose own work is not
characterized by simplicity seemed to admire this
quality.</p>

<p>The greatest men are simple. Affectation, straining
for effect, is a mark of a little mind. The
greatest art is simple,—governed by a noble
restraint. Over-decoration, whether in a picture,
a piece of music, in dress, in the furnishing of
a room, or in a theme, is always a mark of bad
taste.</p>

<p>What is called fine writing—the use of over-ambitious
words to express simple thoughts—grows
up in various ways. Sometimes it springs
from a desire to be funny. Exaggeration has always
been a favorite device of the humorist—especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of the American humorist. There are students who
learn to use this kind of humor so well that an
unconscious habit of bombast pursues them into
their more serious work. Most of us can force a
smile at such writing as the passage given below,
or even laugh at it when there are enough people
present to help us:—</p>

<p>“It was in the sixth that Captain Anson, aided
and abetted by sundry young men generally called
‘Colts,’ waded in to snatch laurel, trailing arbutus,
and other vegetables from the coy hand of
fame. He did it, too, and he now has laurels to
throw to the birds. Ryan went first to the bat,
and pasted a warm one through short that turned
the grass black along its path.”</p>

<p>But when a young fellow has read so much of
this sort that he drags similar diction into his
themes, the fun becomes vulgarity.</p>

<p>In general, use always the simplest word that
will express your meaning exactly. Compare
pages 216, 217.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Literal and Figurative Words.</b>—Before it can be
decided how far the young writer should use figures
of speech, it is necessary to find out the real
difference between a literal word or statement and
a figurative word or statement. If figures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
always mere embellishments of language, the journeyman
had better shun them anxiously; for his
true object is to express his thought, not to decorate
it. If, however, some figures are not embellishments
but ordinary building-material, the case
is different.</p>

<p>When, on seeing biscuits for the first time, a
child refers to them as <i>moons</i>, he is not making an
effort to adorn his language. He is unconsciously
using a figure of speech because he does not know
the literal, proper, conventional name, <i>biscuit</i>. If
the child had formerly lived in a country where
apples grew but potatoes did not, the first time he
saw a potato he would probably call it a <i>ground-apple</i>.
As a matter of fact there are people that have
gone through some such experience with potatoes.
The French word <i>pomme de terre</i> indicates this.</p>

<p>Most words were once figures of speech, that is,
<i>tropes</i>. A trope, from the Greek word τρέπω, to
turn, is merely the turning away of a word from
its ordinary meaning to give a name to some new
idea. The root of many a word shows the figure
that was used to express a given new idea. The
root <i>spir-</i> means to breathe. Since the inability to
breathe is one part of the process of death, the expression
<i>to breathe out</i> became a figurative expression
for the whole idea of “to die.” In <i>expire</i>,
applied to death, the idea of <i>breathe</i> is usually not
felt. The figure is forgotten, and we therefore call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it a root-figure, or <i>radical figure</i>. As may be seen
from the roots of the Curious Words on <a href="#Page_191">page 191</a>,
language is figurative through and through.</p>

<p>This is true not only of language already made,
but of that which is daily making. In every mind
shades of thought are constantly occurring for
which there are either no names, or none which
the mind can learn in the interval before expression
is necessary. If the exact word is not at
hand, a comparison must be made. The shade of
thought must be named by telling what thing in
the reader’s experience it is like.</p>

<p>Does the attempt at comparison result in a
vague, inexact phrase, or in an exact one? The
youth who declares that his lesson is as “hard as
thunder,” has expressed himself but vaguely. The
same is true of the young lady who declares that
it rained “like anything.” Let us examine briefly
the chief kinds of tropes, and note whether they
are necessarily less clear and exact than literal
statements.</p>

<p>A person sees an accident, and reports that “a
score of hands” picked up the injured boy. Here
is <i>synecdoche</i>. The “hands” stand for the persons—a
part for the whole; a “score” probably
stands for a dozen,—the whole number of hands in
the group of people, for the smaller number that
actually touched the boy. Or, the “score” may
be called <i>hyperbole</i>, that is, exaggeration. A critic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
might say that either figure is inexact here. True,
in a way. But if the writer had reported that he
<i>seemed</i> to see a score of hands, the phrase would be
faithful to his thought. We may take the <i>seemed</i>
for granted, and reply to the critic that for exact
purposes in a law court, “seemed to see a score of
hands” might be nearer the truth than an attempt
at greater precision.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that the writer who reported the
accident said that the boy was in great pain, so
that his face was “as white as ivory.” Here is a
<i>simile</i>,—an explicit statement of likeness in two
things which are different in most respects. This
particular simile is certainly more exact than the
literal word <i>white</i> would be.</p>

<p>If now the writer had said, “I caught a glimpse
of compressed lips and ivory face,” the comparison
would have been not explicit, but implied. An implied
comparison is called <i>metaphor</i>. Metaphor is
from the Greek for <i>carrying over</i>, because it carries
over bodily the name of one thing to another. To
speak of a man as “bold as a lion,” is simile; to
call him a “lion” outright, is metaphor. It is
less clear to call a man a lion than to say in
what respect he is like a lion; it is less clear
to say, “ivory face” than to say “face white as
ivory.”</p>

<p>The case of the boy who was injured may have
got into the newspapers. To speak more figuratively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the <i>press</i> may have taken up the matter.
<i>Press</i> stands here for the editors of the various
journals. This last figure is <i>metonymy</i>. In metonymy
one thing is put for another that is often
associated with it. In the sentence given, metonymy
does not seem to detract from clearness;
at all events it saves a roundabout expression.</p>

<p>Metaphor and metonymy, by ascribing life to
inanimate things, often become <i>personification</i>. So
above, where the press <i>takes up</i> a matter. It is
evident that personification need not make a sentence
less intelligible.</p>

<p>Once more, let us suppose that the reporter who
first learned of the boy’s accident remarked, on
handing in his account of it, “The early bird
catches the worm.” The remark is pure <i>allegory</i>—describing
some act or thing indirectly by describing
something else. If the hearer knows
enough of the situation to understand the allegory,
he undoubtedly receives a forcible impression, and
may be helped to a clearer view. Allegory is a
kind of expanded metaphor. It is more liable to
misinterpretation than most figures; but the allegorical
proverbs of our language, and the popularity
of such books as the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, show
that it is a favorite form of expression. Like
general words, allegory can be used to say things
which policy may forbid being said more directly.</p>

<p>From the discussion it appears that tropes can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
often be made to yield a clear and sufficiently
exact phrase. Often however a trope lends force
or beauty rather than clearness. It is forcible
rather than clear to call a man a lion. It is beautiful
rather than clear to speak of the Pleiades as
“a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid.”
Such a phrase as this is legitimate enough in poetry;
it would be legitimate in highly imaginative
prose. But the fact cannot be dodged that it
would be out of place in the midst of plain prose
description.</p>

<p>The practical conclusion is obvious. Use tropes
without hesitation when they are really needed to
give clearness and force. Never use a trope for
decorative purposes only. The ability to write
plain, bare English is absolutely indispensable.
The ability to write figuratively is an enviable, but
not a necessary, possession.</p>

<p>When the need of a figure is actually felt, the
choice should be made with scrupulous care. If
tropes occur to you in numbers, “like flocks of
pigeons,” choose only the pigeon that can carry
a message. To secure lucidity, employ a figure
which makes use of something already clear to the
reader. Every-day life and common things are the
best sources for both similes and metaphors. To
secure force, select such figures as appeal to the
emotional experiences of everybody. If you wish
to hold attention and move your reader, appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
such primal feelings as love, hate, fear, courage,
joy, sorrow, aspiration, hope. Note how Shakespeare
appeals to the human animal’s dread of deep
water: he makes Cardinal Wolsey say, “I have
ventured, like wanton boys that swim on bladders,
this many summers in a sea of glory.” In <i>Macbeth</i>
he appeals to the joy of release from pain: he
calls sleep <i>the balm</i> of each day’s hurt.</p>

<p>A good figure of speech must be consistent.
Although a lively imagination changes its metaphors
from minute to minute, it must not change
them so fast as to suggest ridiculous things. If
the metaphor gets mixed, clearness and force go
to the winds. The other day the writer heard a
young man earnestly exclaim: “Now I shall have
to toe the bee-line!” The thought of that youth,
lifted to a perilous position where his toes sought
vainly in the trackless air for a “bee-line,” was
quite too much for the gravity of his hearers.
This trope that failed to be a trope was about as
effective as the famous lightning-change series of
metaphors uttered by Sir Boyle Roche: “Mr.
Speaker, I smell a rat. I see him floating in the
air. But I will nip him in the bud.” Mixed metaphors
may arise from mere liveliness of imagination,—a
good fault sometimes. More frequently
it arises from vague thinking or from grandiloquence.
The examples on <a href="#Page_246">page 246</a> show how
liable fine writing is to this fault. A figure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is not in good taste is incomparably worse than
no figure at all.</p>

<span class="smaller">LETTER-WRITING</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Why Important.</b>—There are two general classes
of letters: informal or personal, and formal or impersonal.
Each kind is governed by the general
principles of clearness and courtesy. Mischief is
sure to follow if either of these principles is disregarded.
A writer may indulge in extravagance
of statement when he writes for the public, and
“there is no harm done, for the speaker is one and
the listener is another.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But it is quite a different
matter when one is making business promises,
or trying to pacify a distant friend with whom
there is a misunderstanding. A shrewd politician
knows enough not to write too many letters, and
not to write anything that he cannot stand by. A
woman of tact knows that the success of her social
plans may turn upon the choice of a single word
in the leave-taking of a note.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Business Letters.</b>—These are formal, impersonal.
A good business letter is (1) clear, (2) courteous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
(3) brief. It shows unmistakably (<i>a</i>) who is writing,
(<i>b</i>) to whom, (<i>c</i>) where, (<i>d</i>) when. It is definite
in its language, so that there need be no return
letter of inquiry as to any part of its meaning. It
observes the best conventions of address and signature.
It refrains from brusque remarks, even in
reply to a rude letter. It is appreciative. A good
business man always takes into account that a
handful of trade is a handful of gold; if he is
favored with orders, he goes to the trouble of
thanking his customers. It does not curtly abbreviate
sentences and signatures. Life is not so short
but that we may avoid writing such insults as this:
“Y’rs rec’d and contents noted. Have ordered
Jones to push the deal through. Shall see you
soon. Y’rs respy.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Headings and Signatures in Business Letters.</b>—A
business letter should show where it was written,
and where the answer should be sent. If these
places are the same, the one address may be indicated
either at the beginning or at the end, preferably
the former. Street and number should always
be given in the case of city addresses. The date of
writing should be placed at the beginning, the month
being written or abbreviated, not indicated by a
figure. The heading ought also to indicate to whom
the letter is sent. Since in theory or in fact there
may be other persons of the same name, the correspondent’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
address should usually be placed beneath
his name. The most common signatures in business
letters are <i>Yours truly</i>, <i>Yours very truly</i>, and <i>Yours
respectfully</i>. In writing a business letter, a girl
signs her full name. Then at the left she writes
her name, preceded by <i>Miss</i>, and followed by her
address.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Titles in Business Letters.</b>—Firm names need not
be preceded by <i>Messrs.</i>, although this form certainly
adds to the courtesy of the communication. Names
of individuals should regularly be preceded by <i>Mr.</i>
Whether a person should be addressed by his professional
title depends somewhat upon the character
of the business. <i>In the United States a commercial
letter is sufficiently courteous if <b>Mr.</b> precedes the name
of the person addressed.</i> This title is in better
taste, as applied to business men, than <i>Esq.</i> But
there is no objection to the use of certain titles,
and they are desirable if the business be one which
pertains to the profession of the person addressed.
Initials should always be given. “Rev. Brown,”
“Hon. Jones,” are inexcusable forms.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>The Envelope.</b>—The address on the envelope

<p class="tb"><b>Formal Social Letters.</b>—Formal correspondence
indicates by its style the mere acquaintance of the
correspondents, or, in the words of Miss Morton,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
“the bounds of distance which for any reason it is
desirable to maintain.” A formal letter should
actually be formal. If one attempts to do an
elaborate thing, one ought to do it thoroughly and
properly. A letter that begins with formal brevity
and runs off into colloquial prolixity is a burlesque.
A letter that begins in the third person and ends
in the first is a farce.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Personal or Informal Letters.</b>—The letter one
writes informally to an acquaintance, a friend, or
a relative, should be in tone pretty nearly what
one’s conversation with the given person would
be. To give such a letter the tone which represents
exactly the relation between the two people
is a hard task. The nicest sense of tact is required
in order not to be too stiff and not too familiar.
Personal letters demand the art of colloquial composition.
Those unperceptive persons who have but
one style of composition,—that of a book, or that
of a clerk,—make sorry work of personal letters.
Suppose that you have always known one of these
persons. You have played with him, read with
him, perhaps fought with him. When you meet,
he calls you by your first name. When he writes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
ask you to visit him, he addresses you as <i>Dear Sir</i>,
and signs himself <i>Respectfully</i>! His letter gives
you a chill. There is too little of the personal
letter-writing of the better sort, the leisurely,
careful, courteous, old-fashioned kind of written
talk,—writing that, like Thomas Cholmondeley’s,
could be signed, “Ever yours and not in haste.”</p>

an acquaintance would begin: My dear Mr. ——,
My dear Miss ——, etc.</p>

<span class="smaller">REPRODUCTION, ABSTRACT, SUMMARY, ABRIDGMENT</span></h2>

<p class="tb"><b>Literal Reproduction.</b>—The word <i>reproduction</i>
is often used in Rhetoric in a somewhat general
sense, to mean any version of another composition.
As we shall use it, the term means <i>literal reproduction</i>;
in other words, a version that follows the
phrasing of the original as nearly as the time given
for study will permit. Writing of reproductions
trains the memory and adds immensely to one’s
command of words.</p>

<p>Below are given lists of brief selections, most of
them requiring not more than ten minutes to reproduce.
It is suggested that a given paragraph or
page be slowly read aloud to the class, two or three
times, and that the class afterward write the piece
as nearly as possible in the author’s words. <i>Each
student should then insert in his vocabulary book any
new words or phrases that seem to him particularly
serviceable. These memoranda will prove invaluable
later on, when similar topics (not the same ones) are
to be written about by the student himself.</i> To illustrate:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a student after reading two or three personal
descriptions might jot down for future use
such phrases as the following: <i>Eyes.</i>—Laughing,
startled, heavy-lidded, hazel, vacant, protruding,
lustrous, expressive, liquid, dreamy, speaking, glad.
<i>Nose.</i>—Aquiline, Roman, beak-like, shapely, snub,
sharp, insignificant. <i>Hair.</i>—Grizzled, frowsy,
shaggy, glossy, dishevelled, unkempt, tumbled.
<i>Manner.</i>—Alert, jaunty, affable, sprightly, haughty,
pretentious, modest, diffident, reserved, ostentatious,
demure, animated. <i>Figure.</i>—Gaunt, emaciated,
lank, vigorous, robust, grotesque, massive, insignificant,
thick-set, portly, sturdy, stalwart, erect,
decrepit, fragile. <i>Expression.</i>—Rueful, crafty,
frank, wistful, stolid.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Summary, Abstract, Abridgment.</b>—The ability
to arrive at the substance of an article or book and
write it down, is demanded constantly in almost
every business and in every profession. An extremely
brief statement of the substance is called
a <i>summary</i>. A longer statement, couched in language
independent of that used by the author, is
an <i>abstract</i>. If the article or book is shortened by
the omission of the less important parts, the language
of the original being in general retained, the
result is an <i>abridgment</i>.</p>

<p>Almost any well-constructed composition lends
itself to summary, abstract, or abridgment. A
story of Irving or Hawthorne, a chapter of Parkman
or John Fiske, an article in the <i>Forum</i> or the
<i>Nation</i>, furnishes excellent material. Below are
given typical pieces that may be used, the shorter
ones for summary, the longer for abstract or
abridgment. Stories can better be abstracted than
abridged.</p>

<p>It is well to plan the proportions of your version.
The scale of 1:6 (one paragraph to six) will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
be found a good proportion on which to reduce the
longer pieces. Burke’s Speech On Conciliation
would thus reduce to an abstract or an abridgment
of about twenty paragraphs. But this speech
can be reduced on a scale of 1:10 or even 1:20.</p>

<span class="smaller">NARRATION AND DESCRIPTION</span></h2>

<p>Narration, or narrative, relates a series of events.
Description gives an account of the look of persons
or things. Character description gives both physical
and mental traits. Recall to memory various
stories you have read, and say whether narratives
of considerable length do or do not have to give
description as they proceed.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Narration</span></h3>

<p class="tb"><b>Two Kinds.</b>—If a series of events actually
happened, they are historical, and the story of
them may be called <i>historical narrative</i>. If they
did not happen, but owe their existence to the
imagination, they are fictional, and the narrative
is <i>fiction</i>. If we are writing a story, let the fact
be understood; if a sober rehearsal of facts, let
it be made an exercise in the rare and difficult
art of truth-telling.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Exercises in Choice of Subject.</b>—(1) Examine a
daily paper and pick out several narratives which
seem to you to have a general human interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and several that have not. (2) Write a list of
twenty subjects for narrative and submit them to
the class for a vote as to which are the most interesting.
Choose events which you have witnessed
or taken part in. (3) Write a list of what are
to you the most interesting events of ancient, mediæval,
and modern history.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Choice of Details.</b>—In writing an account of a
simple incident it is possible to tell every detail
of what happened. But evidently no such thing
is practicable in narrating the events of a day,
a week, a lifetime. What to omit will depend
much upon the length of the composition. A
clear-headed writer will not put pen to paper before
he has decided just what points he is going
to bring out.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Written Exercise.</b>—(1) Jot down on paper memoranda
of the important things, the turning events,
in your own past life. (2) Make memoranda to
show what events ought to stand out most distinctly
in a history of the United States.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Plot.</b>—Read the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ichabod Crane was ridiculously frightened one dark night
by a boy who played ghost. The lad took the part of a
traditional spectre that rode a black horse. The joker had
a cloak over his head, and before him on the saddle a pumpkin,
to represent the head which the headless horseman was
fabled to carry.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Read now the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One dark night Ichabod Crane started homeward on horseback.
He approached the oak on which André, the spy,
was hanged. Ichabod’s heart quaked. He passed the haunted
tree in safety, but his heart almost stood still when, a little
farther on, he saw a strange rider on a gigantic horse. Horse
and rider kept pace with him. Ichabod however saw that
the latter was headless, nay, carried his head before him on
the saddle. The figure raised itself and hurled its head
at Ichabod. When the schoolmaster found himself on the
ground, did he realize that the grewsome missile was only
a pumpkin?</p>

</div>

<p>Which of these accounts begets <i>suspense as to the
outcome</i>? In other words, in which is there <i>plot</i>?
Recall some novel you have read, and explain how
the reader’s interest is held through to the end.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Oral Exercise.</b>—Recall some anecdote, and present
it orally with plot interest.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Write a simple historical narrative of
about two hundred words, giving without plot all
the details of some brief incident in your own
experience. The following may suggest a topic:
1. My first day at the lathe. 2. Examination
memories. 3. How I earned some money and how
I spent it. 4. Spearing fish by night. 5. A personal
adventure with a window. 6. How I spent
this morning.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Write one or more imaginary newspaper
items, without plot, each detailing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
simple incident. Choose a subject of local interest
if possible. For example: 1. A runaway. 2. Fire
on Seventh Street. 3. Trolley-car accident. 4. Curious
act of a bird. 5. April 23 at the Brown School.
6. Brave deed of a child. 7. He returned $500.
8. An old building demolished. 9. The new library
is opened. 10. Arrested for “scorching.”</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Themes.</b>—Select several topics for five hundred
word themes, and write outlines showing what details
you would emphasize in composing. Then
write historical narratives from the outlines, making
them as interesting as you can without deviating
from facts. Sample subjects: 1. My struggles
with cooking. 2. A day in the berry patch. 3. The
first time I saw a play. 4. An adventure of my
father. 5. A few days with a doctor. 6. How a
certain town was named. 7. Misfortunes of our
circus. 8. The tribulations of a truant. 9. My first
ocean voyage. 10. An uncomfortable call. 11. My
career as an actor. 12. A visit to the World’s Fair.
13. In a graveyard after dark. 14. How Smith
looked me up. 15. A week in the woods. 16. The
fall I had. 17. My experience as a clerk. 18. A
glimpse of college life. 19. What I saw some bees
do. 20. An unwilling swim. 21. That Fourth of
July. 22. Experiences with a pony. 23. Haying.
24. How the vacation passed. 25. When I was a
book-agent. 26. Crossing a swollen stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><b>Complex Incident.</b>—Many a narrative must be
composed of several <i>threads</i>, telling different events
that were going on at the same time. If you were
giving an account of how two hunters after being
separated in the woods finally reached home again,
you would relate first how one got home, then how
the other got home; or, having narrated the wanderings
of the first, you would let the second tell his
own story on rejoining his companion.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>Theme.</b>—Relate a complex incident, either historical
or fictional, in a theme about five hundred
words long. Two or three threads are enough.
The following may suggest a subject: 1. Two roads
to town. 2. How our party reached the top of the
mountain. 3. Adventures of a lost child and its
parents. 4. The rescue of an amateur sailor from
a wreck. 5. What happened at our club meeting.
6. Three boys and a boat. 7. An overheard discussion.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Description</span></h3>

<p>Language is better adapted to narrate than to
describe, for words follow each other, just as events
do; they cannot flash the whole picture, with all
the details, upon the reader. Consequently writers
often combine narrative and description in order to
dwell on details. Homer<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> describes the shield of
Achilles by telling the story of its forging—how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Vulcan wrought each part in turn. What is called
the <i>traveller’s view</i> is description from successive
points of view. There is a good example of this
kind of description in Hawthorne’s <i>American Note
Books</i>, p. 181.</p>

<p>In some descriptions the writer is willing to
sacrifice the general look of the object, in order
to secure accuracy of detail. Giving each detail is
called <i>description by inventory</i>. This is often useful,
particularly in business or in science. Turn to any
book of natural history and read the inventory
description of some bird or animal. But ordinarily
a description should give a general impression
whether it afterward gives details or not. The
most common way of doing this is to tell what in
general the object to be described makes you think
of. If the object is a river, it may remind you of
a snake or a letter S; if a village, it may recall to
your mind a flat-iron; if a little old lady, it may
appear to you, as to Dickens, in <i>Hard Times</i>, “a
bundle of shawls.” The main impression thus received
is called the <i>fundamental image</i>.</p>

<p>Not every object will furnish a fundamental
image, but every object is sure to be remembered
for a few <i>chief details</i>. If of a given landscape
there lingers in the memory only a dim sense of
green woods, with here and there a patch of white,
it is as much description to record this dim image
as it would be to detail kinds of trees, distances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
etc. Indeed, it is a mistake often made to report
in a description things that could not possibly
have been seen from the given point of view. To
<i>keep the point of view</i> is vital. It is a good practice
to describe a photograph—such as those published
by the Soule Company, of Boston—in order to
learn the art of proportion in these matters of
living details.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be thought that details
have no place in description. In studying an
object with a view to writing about it, one should
have the eye of a hawk for every <i>visible</i> detail, in
order that what he writes may be truthful. There
is no better training for the powers of observation
than description. Send a careless person to the
lake to describe it. He reports “myriads of ripples
dancing in glee,” things that every wretched poetaster
has seen before him. Send a careful observer,
and he will report wonderful shades of color, and
curious surface effects, like corrugation and damascene.</p>

<span class="smaller">EXPOSITION AND ARGUMENT</span></h2>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Exposition</span></h3>

<p>Exposition is explanation. It may either explain
a general principle by illustrations and examples,
as the preacher’s sermon expounds a statement of
scripture, or it may explain a group of facts by
getting at their underlying principle, as a scientific
treatise does. Exposition, it is clear, deals with
ideas rather than with particular objects. We
describe a department store; we expound the principles
by which it is conducted. We describe an
electric motor; we expound the laws of electricity.
We describe a beautiful statue; we expound beauty.</p>

<p>Below are given various subjects for exposition.
In writing about them, do not drift into argument.
If you write on “dangers of exercise,” do not
argue against over-exercise; calmly explain the
matter.</p>

<h4 class="center"><i>Subjects for Exposition</i></h4>

<p>1. Golf. 2. Cannibalism. 3. The bear family.
4. Principles of diet. 5. Credulity. 6. Nostalgia.
7. How to sail a boat. 8. Drowned rivers. 9. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
eating candy. 10. The formation of ravines.
11. Dangers of over-exercise. 12. Dangers of
too little exercise. 13. Why the earth quakes.
14. How men become criminals. 15. How the
will may be trained in the classroom. 16. An
ideal classroom. 17. What makes up an ideal
camping ground. 18. Advantages and disadvantages
of classroom study. 19. Effects of climate
on man. 20. The conduct of a great business.
21. What are home missions? 22. How to become
famous. 23. How to plan a dinner. 24. How
to furnish a sitting-room. 25. Advantages of small
classes. 26. Possibilities of electricity. 27. What
constitutes a great man? 28. The art of fly-casting.
29. The construction of a roof. 30. What good
does an examination do the student? 31. Spiritualism.
32. Ghosts. 33. My choice of a profession.
34. The banking system. 35. Practical values of
good manners. 36. The interpretation of any of
the proverbs given on <a href="#Page_213">pages 213-215</a>.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Argument</span></h3>

<p>There are various ways of bringing people to our
way of thinking. One way, by appealing to their
reason, is called <i>argument</i>. Can you suggest other
ways?</p>

<p>Every argument must have a <i>proposition</i>, which
is laid down to be proved. If this proposition is
not stated in the title of the argument, it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
stated early in the discussion. It cannot be too
definitely formulated. Every word of it should
be made clear; there should be full <i>exposition of
terms</i>. Half the quarrels in the world disappear
after a thorough definition of terms. The question
of whether Aaron Burr was guilty of treason depends
on how treason is defined. In law a man,
however traitorous, is not guilty of treason unless
his treason had been witnessed by two persons.
Burr’s treason was not witnessed; he escaped conviction.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In argument (<i>a</i>) depend upon a few weighty
arguments rather than upon many weak ones; (<i>b</i>)
remember that <i>examples</i> are but weak arguments;
(<i>c</i>) if in debate, be perfectly fair to your opponent,
admitting all that is true on his side; (<i>d</i>) know
your case thoroughly in every detail.</p>

<h4 class="center"><i>Subjects for Argument or Debate</i></h4>

<p>1. Examinations are usually a fair test of scholarship.
2. Labor-saving machinery is a permanent
advantage to mankind. 3. The world owes every
man a living. 4. A truthful person will be a
better writer than a liar. 5. The Gulf of Mexico
will one day have a greater port than New York
now has. 6. High school students should read the
newspapers. 7. Observation helps us more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
reading. 8. Examinations should be abolished.
9. Sunday observance should be compulsory. 10. A
high school is guilty of injustice to its students
if it does not train them in public speaking.
11. People possessing no property should not be
allowed to vote. 12. Is it right to break a friendship?
13. Ought department stores to be permitted?
14. Are there good excuses for being a
tramp? 15. Is it wrong to bet? 16. How far is
it right in politics that to the victors should belong
the spoils? 17. Should a parent forbid his son to
take part in football? 18. Should a man ever shoot
a robber? 19. Is suicide ever justifiable? 20. Is it
right to evade custom house duties? 21. Is it
wrong to go to the theatre often? 22. Is it ever
best to give money on the street? 23. Is it right
for women to wear birds on their hats? 24. How
far is it right for students to study together?
25. Is a curfew law desirable? 26. Is it right to
discard old friends for new? 27. Should one bear
witness against a friend? 28. Does paying a fare
entitle one to a seat? 29. Is it right to let people
deceive themselves? 30. Are there any customary
lies which are right? 31. Is capital punishment
defensible as punishment? 32. Is capital punishment
defensible as a protection to society?
33. Should Latin be a compulsory study?
34. Which is rougher, football or pugilism?</p>

<p>“This work gives the student the very gist and germ of the art of composition.”—<i>Public
Opinion.</i></p>

<p>“G. R. Carpenter, Professor of Rhetoric and English Composition in Columbia
College, has prepared a work under the title of ‘Exercises in Rhetoric
and English Composition,’ in which not so much the science of Rhetoric is
mapped out and defined as the practical workings of the art are furnished to
the student with just enough of the principles to guide him aright. The
author gives an abundance of exercises for the student to study and analyze,
and this is the very best kind of help. The scheme of the subject-matter is
somewhat unique and novel, but it is comprehensive and lucid.... A very
serviceable and suggestive book to read and consult.”—<i>Education.</i></p>

<p>“The text represents the substance of teaching which a freshman may
fairly be expected to compass, and it is set forth with a clearness and directness
and brevity so admirable as to make the volume seem almost the realization
of that impossible short method of learning to write which has often
been sought for, but never with a nearer approach to being found.... We
do not hesitate to give unreserved commendation to this little book.”—<i>The
Nation.</i></p>

<p>“Seldom has so much good common sense been put within so brief a
space.”—<i>The Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p>“All lovers of poetry, all students of literature, all readers, will
welcome the volumes of ‘The English Poets.’ ... Mr.
Matthew Arnold has written a most delightful introduction, full
of wise thought and poetic sensibility. Very few books can be
named in which so much that is precious can be had in so little
space and for so little money.”—<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

<p>“Altogether it would be difficult to select four volumes of
any kind better worth owning and studying than these.”—<i>Nation.</i></p>

<p>“These four volumes ought to be placed in every library,
and, if possible, in the hands of every student of English.”—<i>Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“Ward’s ‘English Poets’ has been acknowledged to be one
of the most serviceable and discriminating contributions to the
history of English poetry.”—<i>Quips.</i></p>

<p class="center"><b>COMMENTS.</b></p>

<p>“If prose literature can ever be successfully studied by means of
short extracts, it will be possible to conduct such a study with the aid
of this book. As a companion book of Ward’s ‘English Poets’ it
is very interesting and satisfactory. In the Department of Rhetoric,
this book will certainly be of greater value than any other work of
the kind yet published.”—<span class="smcap">Prof. H. H. Neill</span>, <i>Amherst College</i>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Craik and his coadjutors do their work admirably. Their
remarks are appropriate, their selection of extracts is felicitous. We
thank them for not a few happy hours.”—<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“The extracts are carefully chosen and edited, and a brief sketch
of each writer is given. These sketches are written by men who edit
the different sections, and as these men are selected from the foremost
of English critics, the result is that the books contain a valuable
set of brief essays from able and distinguished pens. George
Saintsbury, Alfred Ainger, Edmund Gosse, Norman Moore, and
others besides the editor himself have contributed, and the book
would have been valuable did it contain nothing but these introductory
notices. The conclusions of the editors of the different authors
who have summed up the characteristics of the separate men represented
in the previous volume, have done their work so well, that
the student is likely in the end to have a rather better idea of the
writers than he would gather from his unaided study of the original
and complete works of these old writers.”—<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

student as well as for class-room use, is to be warmly
commended.... On every page of this admirably arranged

<p>“In respect both of scholarship and of exposition, this volume
is entitled to high praise.... There is no part of this book
that cannot be read with pleasure as well as profit, and one is
therefore embarrassed by the wealth of material worthy of

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
